Can we love someone and betray them? Why does our constant need to \ufb01t in sabotage real belonging? Can we love the people in our lives, like our partners and children, more than we love ourselves? How do we de\ufb01ne worthiness, and why do we so often end up hustling for it rather than believing in it? We encounter obstacles on every journey we make; the Wholehearted journey is no exception."}, {"text": " In the next chapter, we\u2019ll explore what I\u2019ve found to be the greatest barriers to living and loving with our whole hearts and how we can develop effective strategies to move through the barriers and to cultivate resilience.

Sometimes that required developing new de\ufb01nitions (like I actually did with love and many other words). Other times, when I started looking around in the existing literature, I found de\ufb01nitions that captured the spirit of the participants\u2019 experiences."}, {"text": " A good example of this is play. Play is an essential component to Wholehearted living, and when I researched the topic, I discovered the amazing work of Dr. Stuart Brown.1 So, rather than creating a new de\ufb01nition, I reference his work because it accurately re\ufb02ects what I learned in the research."}, {"text": " I realize that de\ufb01nitions spark controversy and disagreement, but I\u2019m okay with that. I\u2019d rather we debate the meaning of words that are important to us than not discuss them at all.

Here\u2019s what I found: Men and women who live Wholeheartedly do indeed DIG Deep. They just do it in a different way.

Courage sounds great, but we need to talk about how it requires us to let go of what other people think, and for most of us, that\u2019s scary. Compassion is something we all want, but are we willing to look at why boundary-setting and saying no is a critical component of compassion? Are we willing to say no, even if we\u2019re disappointing someone?

We\u2019re all in the same boat.\u201d By the time this mother made it to the back of the room where the teacher was still comforting her daughter, she looked calm. Something that I\u2019m sure came in handy when her daughter lunged for her from about six feet away. The moms who stopped and shared their stories of imperfection and vulnerability were practicing courage."}, {"text": " They took the time to stop and say, \u201cHere\u2019s my story. You\u2019re not alone.\u201d They didn\u2019t have to stop and share; they could have easily joined the perfect-parent parade and marched right by her.

Every time we choose courage, we make everyone around us a little better and the world a little braver."}, {"text": " And our world could stand to be a little kinder and braver. Compassion  To prepare for writing my book on shame, I read everything I could \ufb01nd on compassion. I ultimately found a powerful \ufb01t between the stories I heard in the interviews and the work of American Buddhist nun Pema Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n.

It involves learning to relax and allow ourselves to move gently toward what scares us.\u201d 2 What I love about Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n\u2019s de\ufb01nition is her honesty about the vulnerability of practicing compassion. If we take a closer look at the origin of the word compassion, much like we did with courage, we see why compassion is not typically our \ufb01rst response to suffering."}, {"text": " The word compassion is derived from the Latin words pati and cum, meaning  \u2022  15  \u2022  \fTHE GIFTS OF IMPERFECTION  \u201cto suffer with.\u201d I don\u2019t believe that compassion is our default response. I think our \ufb01rst response to pain\u2014ours or someone else\u2019s\u2014is to selfprotect. We protect ourselves by looking for someone or something to blame."}, {"text": " Or sometimes we shield ourselves by turning to judgment or by immediately going into \ufb01x-it mode. Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n addresses our tendency to self-protect by teaching that we must be honest and forgiving about when and how we shut down: \u201cIn cultivating compassion we draw from the wholeness of our experience\u2014our suffering, our empathy, as well as our cruelty and terror."}, {"text": " It has to be this way. Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded. It\u2019s a relationship between equals. Only when we know our own darkness well can we be present with the darkness of others. Compassion becomes real when we recognize our shared humanity.\u201d 3 In my story, Ashley was willing to be in my darkness with me."}, {"text": " She wasn\u2019t there as my helper or to \ufb01x me; she was just with me\u2014as an equal\u2014holding my hand as I waded through my feelings. Boundaries and Compassion  One of the greatest (and least discussed) barriers to compassion practice is the fear of setting boundaries and holding people accountable. I know it sounds strange, but I believe that understanding the connection between boundaries, accountability, acceptance, and compassion has made me a kinder person."}, {"text": " Before the breakdown, I was sweeter\u2014judgmental, resentful, and angry on the inside\u2014but sweeter on the outside. Today, I think I\u2019m genuinely more compassionate, less judgmental and resentful, and way more serious about boundaries. I have no idea what this combination looks like on the outside, but it feels pretty powerful on the inside."}, {"text": " Before this research, I knew a lot about each one of these concepts, but I didn\u2019t understand how they \ufb01t together. During the interviews, it blew my mind when I realized that many of the truly committed compassion practitioners were also the most boundary-conscious people in the study. Compassionate people are boundaried people."}, {"text": " I was stunned. Here\u2019s what I learned: The heart of compassion is really acceptance.  \u2022  16  \u2022  \fCOURAGE, COMPASSION, AND CONNECTION: THE GIFTS OF IMPERFECTION  The better we are at accepting ourselves and others, the more compassionate we become. Well, it\u2019s dif\ufb01cult to accept people when they are hurting us or taking advantage of us or walking all over us."}, {"text": " This research has taught me that if we really want to practice compassion, we have to start by setting boundaries and holding people accountable for their behavior. We live in a blame culture\u2014we want to know whose fault it is and how they\u2019re going to pay. In our personal, social, and political worlds, we do a lot of screaming and \ufb01nger-pointing, but we rarely hold people accountable."}, {"text": " How could we? We\u2019re so exhausted from ranting and raving that we don\u2019t have the energy to develop meaningful consequences and enforce them. From Washington, DC, and Wall Street to our own schools and homes, I think this rage-blame-too-tired-and-busy-to-followthrough mind-set is why we\u2019re so heavy on self-righteous anger and so low on compassion."}, {"text": " Wouldn\u2019t it be better if we could be kinder, but \ufb01rmer? How would our lives be different if there were less anger and more accountability? What would our work and home lives look like if we blamed less but had more respect for boundaries? I was recently brought in to talk with a group of corporate leaders who were trying to manage a dif\ufb01cult reorganization in their company."}, {"text": " One of the project managers told me that, after listening to me talk about the dangers of using shame as a management tool, he was worried that he shamed his team members.

He explained, \u201cI\u2019m so frustrated."}, {"text": " I have two employees who just don\u2019t listen. I explain every single detail of the project, I check to make sure they understand, and they still do it their way. I\u2019m out of options.

What would happen if you told them that you were going to write them up or give them an of\ufb01cial warning the next time they violated protocol and that if it continues, they\u2019re going to lose their jobs?\u201d He shook his head and said, \u201cOh, no."}, {"text": " That\u2019s pretty serious. I\u2019d have to get the human resources people involved. That becomes a big hassle.\u201d Setting boundaries and holding people accountable is a lot more work than shaming and blaming. But it\u2019s also much more effective. Shaming and blaming without accountability is toxic to couples, families, organizations, and communities."}, {"text": " First, when we shame and blame, it moves the focus from the original behavior in question to our own behavior. By the time this boss is \ufb01nished shaming and humiliating his employees in front of their colleagues, the only behavior in question is his. Additionally, if we don\u2019t follow through with appropriate consequences, people learn to dismiss our requests\u2014even if they sound like threats or ultimatums."}, {"text": " If we ask our kids to keep their clothes off the \ufb02oor and they know that the only consequence of not doing it is a few minutes of yelling, it\u2019s fair for them to believe that it\u2019s really not that important to us. It\u2019s hard for us to understand that we can be compassionate and accepting while we hold people accountable for their behaviors."}, {"text": " We can, and, in fact, it\u2019s the best way to do it. We can confront someone about their behavior, or \ufb01re someone, or fail a student, or discipline a child without berating them or putting them down. The key is to separate people from their behaviors\u2014to address what they\u2019re doing, not who they are (I\u2019ll talk more about this in the next chapter)."}, {"text": " It\u2019s also important that we can lean into the discomfort that comes with straddling compassion and boundaries. We have to stay away from convincing ourselves that we hate someone or that they deserve to feel bad so that we can feel better about holding them accountable. That\u2019s where we get into trouble."}, {"text": " When  \u2022  18  \u2022  \fCOURAGE, COMPASSION, AND CONNECTION: THE GIFTS OF IMPERFECTION  we talk ourselves into disliking someone so we\u2019re more comfortable holding them accountable, we\u2019re priming ourselves for the shame and blame game. When we fail to set boundaries and hold people accountable, we feel used and mistreated."}, {"text": " This is why we sometimes attack who they are, which is far more hurtful than addressing a behavior or a choice. For our own sake, we need to understand that it\u2019s dangerous to our relationships and our well-being to get mired in shame and blame, or to be full of selfrighteous anger. It\u2019s also impossible to practice compassion from a place of resentment."}, {"text": " If we\u2019re going to practice acceptance and compassion, we need boundaries and accountability. Connection  I de\ufb01ne connection as the energy that exists between people when they feel seen, heard, and valued; when they can give and receive without judgment; and when they derive sustenance and strength from the relationship."}, {"text": " Ashley and I felt deeply connected after our experience. I know I was seen, heard, and valued. Even though it was scary, I was able to reach out for support and help. And we both felt strengthened and ful\ufb01lled. In fact, a couple of weeks later, Ashley said, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how glad I am that you called me that day."}, {"text": " It helped me so much to know that I\u2019m not the only one who does stuff like that. I also love knowing that I can help you and that you trust me.\u201d Connection begets connection. As a matter of fact, we are wired for connection. It\u2019s in our biology. From the time we are born, we need connection to thrive emotionally, physically, spiritually, and intellectually."}, {"text": " A decade ago, the idea that we\u2019re \u201cwired for connection\u201d might have been perceived as touchy-feely or New Age. Today, we know that the need for connection is more than a feeling or a hunch. It\u2019s hard science. Neuroscience, to be exact. In his book Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships, Daniel Goleman explores how the latest \ufb01ndings in biology and neuroscience con\ufb01rm that we are hardwired for connection and that our relationships shape our biology as well as our experiences."}, {"text": " Goleman  \u2022  19  \u2022  \fTHE GIFTS OF IMPERFECTION  writes, \u201cEven our most routine encounters act as regulators in the brain, priming our emotions, some desirable, others not.

Sometimes we only think we\u2019re connected.

With anxiety, nats are often about overestimating threat and underestimating an individual\u2019s ability to cope, which can maintain any anxiety.

This may involve avoiding the situation, or doing something differently in order to help control their anxiety."}, {"text": " Although this may lower their anxiety in the short term, it can actually maintain and reinforce it in the long term.

Time after time, during the Civil War, Lincoln put a new general at the head of the Army of the Potomac, and each one in turn\u2014McClellan, Pope, Burnside, Hooker, Meade\u2014blundered tragically and drove Lincoln to pacing the floor in despair."}, {"text": " Half the nation savagely condemned these incompetent generals, but  13  \fLincoln, \u201cwith malice toward none, with charity for all,\u201d held his peace.

Their agents were assigned territories, and our company was assigned to two agents, whom I shall refer to as Carl and John."}, {"text": " \u201cOne morning, Carl dropped by our office and casually mentioned that his company had just introduced a new life insurance policy for executives and thought we might be interested later on and he would get back to us when he had more information on it. \u201cThe same day, John saw us on the sidewalk while returning from a coffee break, and he shouted, \u2018Hey Luke, hold up, I have some great news for you fellows."}, {"text": "\u2019 He hurried over and very excitedly told us about an executive life insurance policy his company had introduced that very day (it was the same policy that Carl had casually mentioned). He wanted us to have one of the first issued. He gave us a few important facts about the coverage and ended saying, \u2018The policy is so new, I\u2019m going to have someone from the home office come out tomorrow and explain it."}, {"text": " Now, in the meantime, let\u2019s get the applications signed and on the way so he can have more information to work with.\u2019 His enthusiasm aroused in us an eager want for this policy even though we still did not have details. When they were made available to us, they confirmed John\u2019s initial understanding of the policy, and he not only sold each of us a policy, but later doubled our coverage."}, {"text": " \u201cCarl could have had those sales, but he made no effort to arouse in us any desire for the policies.\u201d The world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking. So the rare individual who unselfishly tries to serve others has an enormous advantage. He has little competition. Owen D. Young, a noted lawyer and one of America\u2019s great business leaders, once said, \u201cPeople who can put themselves in the place of other people who can understand the workings of their minds, need never worry about what the future has in store for them."}, {"text": "\u201d  29  \fIf out of reading this book you get just one thing\u2014an increased tendency to think always in terms of other people\u2019s point of view, and see things from their angle\u2014if you get that one thing out of this book, it may easily prove to be one of the building blocks of your career. Looking at the other person\u2019s point of view and arousing in him an eager want for something is not to be construed as manipulating that person so that he will do something that is only for your benefit and his detriment."}, {"text": " Each party should gain from the negotiation. In the letters to Mr. Vermylen, both the sender and the receiver of the correspondence gained by implementing what was suggested.

Whidden of Warwick, Rhode Island, who is a territory salesman for the Shell Oil Company."}, {"text": " Mike wanted to become the Number One salesperson in his district, but one service station was holding him back. It was run by an older man who could not be motivated to clean up his station. It was in such poor shape that sales were declining significantly. This manager would not listen to any of Mike\u2019s pleas to upgrade the station."}, {"text": " After many exhortations and heart-to-heart talks\u2014all of which had no impact\u2014Mike decided to invite the manager to visit the newest Shell station in his territory. The manager was so impressed by the facilities at the new station that when Mike visited him the next time, his station was cleaned up and had recorded a sales increase."}, {"text": " This enabled Mike to reach the Number One spot in his district. All his talking and discussion hadn\u2019t helped, but by arousing an eager want in the manager, by showing him the modern station, he had accomplished his goal, and both the manager and Mike benefited.

Oh, no. Not House. He was too adroit for that. He didn\u2019t care about credit. He wanted results. So he let Wilson continue to feel that the idea was his. House did even more than that.

The result? They obeyed\u2026obeyed sullenly and with resentment. After I rode on over the hill, they probably rebuilt the fire and longed to burn up the whole park.

Here is the story in McAdoo's own words: \u201cHe [Wilson] said that he was making up his cabinet and that he would be very glad if I would accept a place in it as Secretary of the Treasury."}, {"text": " He had a delightful way of putting things; he created the impression that by accepting this great honor I would be doing him a favor.\u201d Unfortunately, Wilson didn\u2019t always employ such taut. If he had, history might have been different. For example, Wilson didn\u2019t make the Senate and the Republican Party happy by entering the United States in the League of Nations."}, {"text": " Wilson refused to take such prominent Republican leaders as Elihu Root or Charles Evans Hughes or Henry Cabot Lodge to the peace conference with him. Instead, he took along unknown men from his own party. He snubbed the Republicans, refused to let them feel that the League was their idea as well as his, refused to let them have a finger in the pie; and, as a result of this crude handling of human relations, wrecked his own career, ruined his health, shortened his life, caused America to stay out of the League, and altered the history of the world."}, {"text": " Statesmen and diplomats aren\u2019t the only ones who use this make-a-person-happy-yo-do-things-youwant-them-to-do approach.

For every bushel basket full of pears you pick up, I\u2019ll pay you one dollar."}, {"text": " But after you are finished, for every pear I find left in the yard, I\u2019ll take away a dollar.

Not by merely talking about the fact that he was too busy and toothis and too-that. No, after expressing his appreciation of the invitation and regretting his inability to accept it, he suggested a substitute speaker. In other words, he didn\u2019t give the other person any time to feel unhappy about the refusal, He immediately changed the other person\u2019s thoughts to some other speaker who could accept the invitation."}, {"text": " Gunter Schmidt, who took our course in West Germany, told of an employee in the food store he managed who was negligent about putting the proper price tags on the shelves where the items were displayed.

It was a cold January night in 1935, but the weather couldn\u2019t keep them away. Two thousand five hundred men and women thronged into the grand ballroom of the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York. Every available seat was filled by half-past seven."}, {"text": " At eight o\u2019clock, the eager crowd was still pouring in. The spacious balcony was soon jammed. Presently even standing space was at a premium, and hundreds of people, tired after navigating a day in business, stood up for an hour and a half that night to witness\u2014what? A fashion show? A six-day bicycle race or a personal appearance by Clark Gable? No."}, {"text": " These people had been lured there by a newspaper ad. Two evenings previously, they had seen this full-page announcement in the New York Sun staring them in the face: Learn to Speak Effectively Prepare for Leadership Old stuff? Yes, but believe it or not, in the most sophisticated town on earth, during a depression with 20 percent of the population on relief, twenty-five hundred people had left their homes and hustled to the hotel in response to that ad."}, {"text": " The people who responded were of the upper economic strata\u2014executives, employers and professionals. These men and women had come to hear the opening gun of an ultramodern, ultrapractical course in \u201cEffective Speaking and Influencing Men in Business\u201d\u2014a course given by the Dale Carnegie Institute of Effective Speaking and Human Relations."}, {"text": " Why were they there, these twenty-five hundred business men and women? Because of a sudden hunger for more education because of the depression? Apparently not, for this same course had been playing to packed houses in New York City every season for the preceding twenty-four years. During that time, more than fifteen thousand business and professional people had been trained by Dale Carnegie."}, {"text": " Even large, skeptical, conservative organizations such as the Westinghouse Electric Company, the McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, the Brooklyn Union Gas Company, the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and the New York Telephone Company have had this training conducted in their own offices for the benefit of their members and executives."}, {"text": " The fact that these people, ten or twenty years after leaving grade school, high school or college, come and take this training is a glaring commentary on the shocking deficiencies of our educational system. What do adults really want to study? That is an important question; and in order to answer it, the University of Chicago, the American Association for Adult Education, and the United Y."}, {"text": "M.C.A. Schools made a survey over a two-year period. That survey revealed that the prime interest of adults is health. It also revealed that their second interest is in developing skill in human relationships\u2014they want to learn the technique of getting along with and influencing other people. They don\u2019t want to become public speakers, and they don\u2019t want to listen to a lot of high-sounding talk about psychology; they want suggestions they can use immediately in business, in social contacts and in the home."}, {"text": "  128  \fSo that was what adults wanted to study, was it? \u201cAll right,\u201d said the people making the survey. \u201cFine. If that is what they want, we\u2019ll give it to them.\u201d Looking around for a textbook, they discovered that no working manual had ever been written to help people solve their daily problems in human relationships."}, {"text": " Here was a fine kettle of fish! For hundreds of years, learned volumes had been written on Greek and Latin and higher mathematics\u2014topics about which the average adult doesn\u2019t give two hoots. But on the one subject on which he has a thirst for knowledge, a veritable passion for guidance and help\u2014nothing! This explained the presence of twenty-five hundred eager adults crowding into the grand ballroom of the Hotel Pennsylvania in response to a newspaper advertisement."}, {"text": " Here, apparently, at last was the thing for which they had long been seeking. Back in high school and college, they had pored over books, believing that knowledge alone was the open sesame to financial\u2014and professional rewards. But a few years in the rough-and-tumble of business and professional life had brought sharp disillusionment."}, {"text": " They had seen some of the most important business successes won by men who possessed, in addition to their knowledge, the ability to talk well, to win people to their way of thinking, and to \"sell\" themselves and their ideas. They soon discovered that if one aspired to wear the captain\u2019s cap and navigate the ship of business, personality and the ability to talk are more important than a knowledge of Latin verbs or a sheepskin from Harvard."}, {"text": " The advertisement in the New York Sun promised that the meeting would be highly entertaining. It was. Eighteen people who had taken the course were marshaled in front of the loudspeaker\u2014and fifteen of them were given precisely seventy-five seconds each to tell his or her story. Only seventy-five seconds of talk, then \u201cbang\u201d went the gavel, and the chairman shouted, \u201cTime! Next speaker!\u201d The affair moved with the speed of a herd of buffalo thundering across the plains."}, {"text": " Spectators stood for an hour and a half to watch the performance. The speakers were a cross section of life: several sales representatives, a chain store executive, a baker, the president of a trade association, two bankers, an insurance agent, an accountant, a dentist, an architect, a druggist who had come from Indianapolis to New York to take the course, a lawyer who had come from Havana in order to prepare himself to give one important three-minute speech."}, {"text": " The first speaker bore the Gaelic name Patrick J. O'Haire. Born in Ireland, he attended school for only four years, drifted to America, worked as a mechanic, then as a chauffeur. Now, however, he was forty, he had a growing family and needed more money, so he tried selling trucks. Suffering from an inferiority complex that, as he put it, was eating his heart out, he had to walk up and down in front of an office half a dozen times before he could summon up enough courage to open the door."}, {"text": " He was so discouraged as a salesman that he was thinking of going back to working with his hands in a machine shop, when one day he received a letter inviting him to an organization meeting of the Dale Carnegie Course in Effective Speaking. He didn\u2019t want to attend. He feared he would have to associate with a lot of college graduates, that he would be out of place."}, {"text": " His despairing wife insisted that he go, saying, \u201cIt may do you some good, Pat. God knows you need it.\u201d He went down to the place where the meeting was to be held and stood on the sidewalk for five minutes before he could generate enough self-confidence to enter the room. The first few times he tried to speak in front of the others, he was dizzy with fear."}, {"text": " But as the weeks drifted by, he lost all fear of audiences and soon found that he loved to talk\u2014the bigger the crowd, the better. And he also lost his fear of individuals and of his superiors. He presented his ideas to them, and soon he had  129  \fbeen advanced into the sales department. He had become a valued and much liked member of his company."}, {"text": " This night, in the Hotel Pennsylvania, Patrick O'Haire stood in front of twenty-five hundred people and told a gay, rollicking story of his achievements. Wave after wave of laughter swept over the audience. Few professional speakers could have equaled his performance. The next speaker, Godfrey Meyer, was a gray-headed banker, the father of eleven children."}, {"text": " The first time he had attempted to speak in class, he was literally struck dumb. His mind refused to function. His story is a vivid illustration of how leadership gravitates to the person who can talk. He worked on Wall Street, and for twenty-five years he had been living in Clifton, New Jersey. During that time, he had taken no active part in community affairs and knew perhaps five hundred people."}, {"text": " Shortly after he had enrolled in the Carnegie course, he received his tax bill and was infuriated by what he considered unjust charges. Ordinarily, he would have sat at home and fumed, or he would have taken it out in grousing to his neighbors. But instead, he put on his hat that night, walked into the town meeting, and blew off steam in public."}, {"text": " As a result of that talk of indignation, the citizens of Clifton, New Jersey, urged him to run for the town council. So for weeks he went from one meeting to another, denouncing waste and municipal extravagance. There were ninety-six candidates in the field. When the ballots were counted, lo, Godfrey Meyer\u2019s name led all the rest."}, {"text": " Almost overnight, he had become a public figure among the forty thousand people in his community. As a result of his talks, he made eighty times more friends in six weeks than he had been able to previously in twenty-five years. And his salary as councilman meant that he got a return of 1,000 percent a year on his investment in the Carnegie course."}, {"text": " The third speaker, the head of a large national association of food manufacturers, told how he had been unable to stand up and express his ideas at meetings of a board of directors. As a result of learning to think on his feet, two astonishing things happened. He was soon made president of his association, and in that capacity, he was obliged to address meetings all over the United States."}, {"text": " Excerpts from his talks were put on the Associated Press wires and printed in newspapers and trade magazines throughout the country. In two years, after learning to speak more effectively, he received more free publicity for his company and its products than he had been able to get previously with a quarter of a million dollars spent in direct advertising."}, {"text": " This speaker admitted that he had formerly hesitated to telephone some of the more important business executives in Manhattan and invite them to lunch with him. But as a result of the prestige he had acquired by his talks, these same people telephoned him and invited him to lunch and apologized to him for encroaching on his time."}, {"text": " The ability to speak is a shortcut to distinction. It puts a person in the limelight, raises one head and shoulders above the crowd. And the person who can speak acceptably is usually given credit for an ability out of all proportion to what he or she really possesses. A movement for adult education has been sweeping over the nation; and the most spectacular force in that movement was Dale Carnegie, a man who listened to and critiqued more talks by adults than has any other man in captivity."}, {"text": " According to a cartoon by \"Believe-It-or-Not\u201d Ripley, he had criticized 150,000 speeches. If that grand total doesn\u2019t impress you, remember that it meant one talk for almost every day that has passed since Columbus discovered America. Or, to put it in other words, if all the people who had spoken before him had used only three minutes and had appeared before him in succession, it would have taken ten months, listening day and night, to hear them all."}, {"text": " Dale Carnegie\u2019s own career, filled with sharp contrasts, was a striking example of what a person can accomplish when obsessed with an original idea and afire with enthusiasm. Born on a Missouri farm ten miles from a railway, he never saw a streetcar until he was twelve years old; yet by the time he was forty-six, he was familiar with the far-flung corners of the earth, everywhere from  130  \fHong Kong to Hammerfest; and, at one time, he approached closer to the North Pole than Admiral Byrd\u2019s headquarters at Little America was to the South Pole."}, {"text": " This Missouri lad who had once picked strawberries and cut cockleburs for five cents an hour became the highly paid trainer of the executives of large corporations in the art of self-expression. This erstwhile cowboy who had once punched cattle and branded calves and ridden fences out in western South Dakota later went to London to put on shows under the patronage of the royal family."}, {"text": " This chap who was a total failure the first half-dozen times he tried to speak in public later became my personal manager. Much of my success has been due to training under Dale Carnegie. Young Carnegie had to struggle for an education, for hard luck was always battering away at the old farm in northwest Missouri with a flying tackle and a body slam."}, {"text": " Year after year, the \u201c102\u201d River rose and drowned the corn and swept away the hay. Season after season, the fat hogs sickened and died from cholera, the bottom fell out of the market for cattle and mules, and the bank threatened to foreclose the mortgage. Sick with discouragement, the family sold out and bought another farm near the State Teachers\u2019 College at Warrensburg, Missouri."}, {"text": " Board and room could be had in town for a dollar a day, but young Carnegie couldn\u2019t afford it. So he stayed on the farm and commuted on horseback three miles to college each day. At home, he milked the cows, cut the wood, fed the hogs, and studied his Latin verbs by the light of a coal-oil lamp until his eyes blurred and he began to nod."}, {"text": " Even when he got to bed at midnight, he set the alarm for three o\u2019clock. His father bred pedigreed Duroc-Jersey hogs\u2014and there was danger, during the bitter cold nights, that the young pigs would freeze to death; so they were put in a basket, covered with a gunny sack, and set behind the kitchen stove."}, {"text": " True to their nature, the pigs demanded a hot meal at 3 A.M. So when the alarm went off, Dale Carnegie crawled out of the blankets, took the basket of pigs out to their mother, waited for them to nurse, and then brought them back to the warmth of the kitchen stove. There were six hundred students in State Teachers\u2019 College, and Dale Carnegie was one of the isolated half-dozen who couldn\u2019t afford to board in town."}, {"text": " He was ashamed of the poverty that made it necessary for him to ride back to the farm and milk the cows every night. He was ashamed of his coat, which was too tight, and his trousers, which were too short. Rapidly developing an inferiority complex, he looked about for some shortcut to distinction. He soon saw that there were certain groups in college that enjoyed influence and prestige\u2014the football and baseball players and the chaps who won the debating and public-speaking contests."}, {"text": " Realizing that he had no flair for athletics, he decided to win one of the speaking contests. He spent months preparing his talks. He practiced as he sat in the saddle galloping to college and back; he practiced his speeches as he milked the cows; and then he mounted a bale of hay in the barn and with great gusto and gestures harangued the frightened pigeons about the issues of the day."}, {"text": " But in spite of all his earnestness and preparation, he met with defeat after defeat. He was eighteen at the time-sensitive and proud. He became so discouraged, so depressed, that he even thought of suicide. And then suddenly he began to win, not one contest, but every speaking contest in college. Other students pleaded with him to train them; and they won also."}, {"text": " After graduating from college, he started selling correspondence courses to the ranchers among the sand hills of western Nebraska and eastern Wyoming. In spite of all his boundless energy and enthusiasm, he couldn\u2019t make the grade. He became so discouraged that he went to his hotel room in Alliance, Nebraska, in the middle of the day, threw himself across the bed, and wept in despair."}, {"text": " He longed to go back to college, he longed to retreat from the harsh battle of life; but he couldn\u2019t. So he resolved to go to Omaha and get another job. He didn\u2019t have the money for a railroad ticket, so he traveled on a freight train, feeding and watering two carloads of wild horses in return for his passage, After landing in south Omaha, he got a job selling bacon and soap and lard for Armour and Company."}, {"text": " His territory was up among the Badlands and the cow and Indian country of western South Dakota. He covered his territory by freight train and stagecoach and horseback and slept in pioneer hotels where the only partition between the rooms was a sheet of muslin. He studied books on salesmanship, rode bucking bronchos, played poker with the Indians, and learned how to collect money."}, {"text": " And when, for example, an inland storekeeper couldn\u2019t pay cash for the bacon and hams he had ordered, Dale  131  \fCarnegie would take a dozen pairs of shoes off his shelf, sell the shoes to the railroad men, and forward the receipts to Armour and Company. He would often ride a freight train a hundred miles a day."}, {"text": " When the train stopped to unload freight, he would dash uptown, see three or four merchants, get his orders; and when the whistle blew, he would dash down the street again lickety-split and swing onto the train while it was moving. Within two years, he had taken an unproductive territory that had stood in the twenty-fifth place and had boosted it to first place among all the twenty-nine car routes leading out of south Omaha."}, {"text": " Armour and Company offered to promote him, saying: \u201cYou have achieved what seemed impossible.\u201d But he refused the promotion and resigned, went to New York, studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, and toured the country, playing the role of Dr. Hartley in Polly of the Circus. He would never be a Booth or a Barrymore."}, {"text": " He had the good sense to recognize that, So back he went to sales work, selling automobiles and trucks for the Packard Motor Car Company. He knew nothing about machinery and cared nothing about it. Dreadfully unhappy, he had to scourge himself to his task each day. He longed to have time to study, to write the books he had dreamed about writing back in college."}, {"text": " So he resigned. He was going to spend his days writing stories and novels and support himself by teaching in a night school. Teaching what? As he looked back and evaluated his college work, he saw that his training in public speaking had done more to give him confidence, courage, poise and the ability to meet and deal with people in business than had all the rest of his college courses put together, so he urged the Y."}, {"text": "M.C.A. schools in New York to give him a chance to conduct courses in public speaking for people in business. What? Make orators out of business people? Absurd. The Y.M.C.A. people knew. They had tried such courses\u2014and they had always failed. When they refused to pay him a salary of two dollars a night, he agreed to teach on a commission basis and take a percentage of the net profits\u2014if there were any profits to take."}, {"text": " And inside of three years they were paying him thirty dollars a night on that basis\u2014instead of two. The course grew. Other \u2018Ys\u2019 heard of it, then other cities. Dale Carnegie soon became a glorified circuit rider covering New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and later London and Paris. All the textbooks were too academic and impractical for the business people who flocked to his courses."}, {"text": " Because of this he wrote his own book entitled Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business. It became the official text of all the Y.M.C.A.s as well as of the American Bankers\u2019 Association and the National Credit Men\u2019s Association. Dale Carnegie claimed that all people can talk when they get mad."}, {"text": " He said that if you hit the most ignorant man in town on the jaw and knock him down, he would get on his feet and talk with an eloquence, heat and emphasis that would have rivaled that world famous orator William Jennings Bryan at the height of his career. He claimed that almost any person can speak acceptably in public if he or she has self-confidence and an idea that is boiling and stewing within."}, {"text": " The way to develop self-confidence, he said, is to do the thing you fear to do and get a record of successful experiences behind you. So he forced each class member to talk at every session of the course. The audience is sympathetic. They are all in the same boat; and, by constant practice, they develop a courage, confidence and enthusiasm that carry over into their private speaking."}, {"text": " Dale Carnegie would tell you that he made a living all these years, not by teaching public speaking that was incidental. His main job was to help people conquer their fears and develop courage. He started out at first to conduct merely a course in public speaking, but the students who came were businessmen and women."}, {"text": " Many of them hadn\u2019t seen the inside of a classroom in thirty years. Most of them were paying their tuition on the installment plan. They wanted results and they wanted them quick\u2014results that they could use the next day in business interviews and in speaking before groups. So he was forced to be swift and practical."}, {"text": " Consequently, he developed a system of training that is unique\u2014a striking combination of public speaking, salesmanship, human relations and applied psychology.  132  \fA slave to no hard-and-fast rules, he developed a course that is as real as the measles and twice as much fun. When the classes terminated, the graduates formed clubs of their own and continued to meet fortnightly for years afterward."}, {"text": " One group of nineteen in Philadelphia met twice a month during the winter season for seventeen years. Class members frequently travel fifty or a hundred miles to attend classes. One student used to commute each week from Chicago to New York. Professor William James of Harvard used to say that the average person develops only 10 percent of his latent mental ability."}, {"text": "INTRODUC TION  Dialectical Behavior Therapy: An Overview of the Treatment  Dialectical behavior therapy, developed by Marsha Linehan (1993a, 1993b), is extraordinarily effective at helping people manage overwhelming emotions.

It\u2019s as if the knob is turned to maximum volume on much of what they feel. When they get angry or sad or scared, it shows up as a big, powerful wave that can sweep them off their feet. If you\u2019ve faced overwhelming emotions in your life, you know what we\u2019re talking about."}, {"text": " There are days when your feelings hit you with the force of a tsunami. And when that happens, it makes you\u2014understandably\u2014afraid to feel things because you don\u2019t want to get swept away by your emotions. The trouble is, the more you try to suppress or put a lid on your emotions, the more overwhelming they can get."}, {"text": " We\u2019ll talk about that in chapters 6 and 7 on emotional regulation. What\u2019s important to know right now is that trying to stop your feelings doesn\u2019t work. There\u2019s a fair amount of research to suggest that the likelihood of developing intense, overwhelming emotions may be hardwired from birth."}, {"text": " But it can also be greatly affected by trauma or neglect during childhood. Trauma at critical points in our development can literally alter our brain structure in ways that make us more vulnerable to intense, negative emotions.

Distraction skills are important because (1) they can temporarily stop you from thinking about your pain and, as a result, (2) they give you time to find an appropriate coping response."}, {"text": " Remember how Sandra carried her pain with her for three days? She couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her argument with Maria. Distraction can help you let go of the pain by helping you think about something else. Distraction also buys you time so that your emotions can settle down before you take action to deal with a \u00addistressing situation."}, {"text": " However, do not confuse distraction with avoidance. When you avoid a distressing situation, you choose not to deal with it. But when you distract yourself from a distressing \u00adsituation, you still intend to deal with it in the future, when your emotions have calmed down to a tolerable level. The second group of distress tolerance skills you\u2019ll learn in this chapter are self-\u00adsoothing skills (Johnson, 1985; Linehan, 1993b)."}, {"text": " It\u2019s often necessary to soothe yourself before you face the cause of your distress because your emotions might be too \u201chot.\u201d Many people with overwhelming emotions panic when faced with an argument, rejection, failure, or other painful events. Before you can address these problems with your new emotion regulation skills (chapters 6 and 7) or your new interpersonal effectiveness skills (chapters 8 and 9), it\u2019s often necessary to soothe yourself to regain your strength."}, {"text": " In situations like these, distress tolerance skills are similar to refilling the gas in your car so that you can keep going. Self-soothing is meant to bring you some amount of peace and relief from your pain so that you can figure out what you\u2019re going to do next.  Basic Distress Tolerance Skills\u2003\u2003 9  \fSelf-soothing skills also serve another purpose."}, {"text": " They\u2019ll help you learn to treat yourself compassionately. Many people with overwhelming emotions have been abused or neglected as children. As a result, they were taught more about how to hurt than to help themselves. The second purpose of the self-soothing skills, therefore, is to teach you how to treat yourself kindly and lovingly."}, {"text": "  HOW TO USE THIS CHAPTER As you read the following groups of skills, mark the ones that are helpful to you. This will make it easier to create a distraction plan for emergencies when you get to the end of this chapter. You\u2019ll also be shown how to create a list of relaxation skills to help soothe yourself, both at home and when you\u2019re away."}, {"text": " Then, in the next chapter, you\u2019ll learn more advanced distress tolerance skills.  RADICAL ACCEPTANCE Increasing your ability to tolerate distress starts with a change in your attitude. You\u2019re going to need something called radical acceptance (Linehan, 1993a). This is a new way of looking at your life."}, {"text": " In the next chapter, you\u2019ll be given some key questions to help you examine your experiences using radical acceptance. But for now, it will be sufficient to cover this concept briefly. Often, when a person is in pain, his or her first reaction is to get angry or upset or to blame someone for causing the pain in the first place."}, {"text": " But unfortunately, no matter who you blame for your distress, your pain still exists and you continue to suffer. In fact, in some cases, the angrier you get, the worse your pain will feel (Greenwood, Thurston, Rumble, Waters, & Keefe, 2003; Kerns, Rosenberg, & Jacob, 1994). Getting angry or upset over a situation also stops you from seeing what is really happening."}, {"text": " Have you ever heard the expression \u201cbeing blinded by rage\u201d? This often happens to people with overwhelming emotions. Criticizing yourself all the time or being overly judgmental of a situation is like wearing dark sunglasses indoors. By doing this, you\u2019re missing the details and not seeing everything as it really is."}, {"text": " By getting angry and thinking that a situation should never have \u00adhappened, you\u2019re missing the point that it did happen and that you have to deal with it. Being overly critical about a situation prevents you from taking steps to change that situation. You can\u2019t change the past. And if you spend your time fighting the past\u2014wishfully thinking that your anger will change the outcome of an event that has already happened\u2014you\u2019ll become paralyzed and helpless."}, {"text": " Then, nothing will improve. So, to review\u2014being overly judgmental of a situation or overly critical of yourself often leads to more pain, missed details, and paralysis. Obviously, getting angry, upset, or critical doesn\u2019t improve a situation. So what else can you do? The other option, which radical acceptance suggests, is to acknowledge your present situation, whatever it is, without judging the events or criticizing yourself."}, {"text": " Instead, try to recognize that your present situation exists because of a long chain of events that began far in the past. For example,  10\u2003\u2003The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook  \fsome time ago, you (or someone else) thought you needed help for the emotional pain you were experiencing."}, {"text": " So, a few days later, you went to the bookstore and bought this book. Then today you thought about reading this chapter, and eventually you sat down, opened the book, and began reading. Now, you are up to the words you see here. Denying this chain of events does nothing to change what has already happened."}, {"text": " Trying to fight this moment or say that it shouldn\u2019t be only leads to more suffering for you. Radical acceptance means looking at yourself and the situation and seeing it as it really is. Keep in mind that radical acceptance does not mean that you condone or agree with bad behavior in others. But it does mean that you stop trying to change what\u2019s happened by getting angry and blaming the situation."}, {"text": " For example, if you\u2019re in an abusive relationship and you need to get out, then get out. Don\u2019t waste your time and continue to suffer by blaming yourself or the other person. That won\u2019t help you. Refocus your attention on what you can do now. This will allow you to think more clearly and figure out a better way to cope with your suffering."}, {"text": "  Radical Acceptance Coping Statements To help you begin using radical acceptance, it\u2019s often helpful to use a coping statement to remind yourself.

Mindfulness, also known as meditation, is a valuable skill that has been taught for thousands of years in many of the world\u2019s religions, including Christianity (Merton, 1960), Judaism (Pinson, 2004), Buddhism (Rahula, 1974), and Islam (Inayat Khan, 2000)."}, {"text": " Beginning in the 1980s, Jon Kabat-Zinn began using nonreligious mindfulness skills to help hospital patients cope with chronic pain problems (Kabat-Zinn, 1982; Kabat-Zinn, Lipworth, & Burney, 1985; Kabat-Zinn, Lipworth, Burney, & Sellers, 1987). More recently, similar mindfulness techniques were also integrated into other forms of psychotherapy (Segal, Williams, & Teasdale, 2002), including dialectical behavior therapy (Linehan, 1993a)."}, {"text": " Studies have shown mindfulness skills to be effective at reducing the odds of having another major depressive episode (Teasdale et al., 2000); reducing symptoms of anxiety (Kabat-Zinn et al., 1992); reducing chronic pain (Kabat-Zinn et al., 1985; Kabat-Zinn et al., 1987); decreasing binge eating (Kristeller & Hallett, 1999); increasing tolerance of distressing  \fsituations; increasing relaxation; and increasing skills to cope with difficult situations (Baer, 2003)."}, {"text": " As a result of findings like these, mindfulness is \u00adconsidered one of the most important core skills in dialectical behavior therapy (Linehan, 1993a). So what exactly is mindfulness? One definition is offered above by mindfulness researcher Jon Kabat-Zinn. But for the purposes of this book, mindfulness is the ability to be aware of your thoughts, emotions, physical sensations, and actions\u2014in the present moment\u2014without judging or \u00adcriticizing \u00adyourself or your experience."}, {"text": " Have you ever heard the expressions \u201cbe in the moment\u201d or \u201cbe here now\u201d? These are both different ways of saying: \u201cbe mindful of what\u2019s happening to you.\u201d But this isn\u2019t always an easy task. At any moment in time, you might be thinking, feeling, sensing, and doing many different things."}, {"text": " For example, consider what\u2019s happening to you right now. You\u2019re probably sitting somewhere, reading these words. But at the same time, you\u2019re also breathing, listening to the sounds around you, noticing what the book feels like, noticing the weight of your body resting in the chair, and maybe you\u2019re even thinking about something else."}, {"text": " It\u2019s also possible that you\u2019re aware of your emotional and physical states of being happy, sad, tired, or excited. Maybe you\u2019re even aware of bodily sensations, such as your heart beating or the rising and falling of your chest as you breathe. You might even be doing something that you\u2019re completely unaware of, like shaking your leg, humming, or resting your head in your hand."}, {"text": " That\u2019s a lot to be aware of, and right now, you\u2019re just reading a book. Imagine what\u2019s happening to you when you\u2019re doing other things in your life, like talking with someone or dealing with people at work. The truth is, no one is 100 percent mindful all the time. But the more mindful you learn to be, the more control you will gain over your life."}, {"text": " But remember, time never stands still and each second of your life is different. Because of this, it\u2019s important that you learn to be aware \u201cin each present moment.\u201d For example, by the time you finish reading this sentence, the moment that you started reading it is gone and your present moment is now different."}, {"text": " In fact, you are now different. The cells in your body are constantly dying and being replaced, so physically you\u2019re different. Equally important, your thoughts, feelings, sensations, and actions are never exactly the same in every situation, so they\u2019re different too. For these reasons, it\u2019s important that you learn to be mindful of how your experience changes in each individual moment of your life."}, {"text": " And lastly, in order to be fully aware of your experiences in the present moment, it\u2019s necessary that you do so without criticizing yourself, your situation, or other people. In dialectical behavior therapy this is called radical acceptance (Linehan, 1993a). As described in chapter 2, radical acceptance means tolerating something without judging it or trying to change it."}, {"text": " This is important because if you\u2019re judging yourself, your experience, or someone else in the present moment, then you\u2019re not really paying attention to what\u2019s happening in that moment. For example, many people spend a lot of time worrying about mistakes they\u2019ve made in the past or worrying about mistakes that they might make in the future."}, {"text": " But while they\u2019re doing this, their focus is no longer on what\u2019s happening to them now; their thoughts are somewhere else. As a result, they live in a painful past or future, and life feels very difficult.

In order to breathe mindfully, you need to focus on three parts of the experience. First, you must count your breaths. This will help you focus your attention, and it will also help you calm your mind when you\u2019re distracted by thoughts."}, {"text": " Second, you need to focus on the physical experience of breathing. This is accomplished by observing the rising and falling of your chest and stomach as you inhale and exhale. And third, you need to be aware of any distracting thoughts that arise while you\u2019re breathing. Then you need to let the thoughts go without getting stuck on them, as in the previous Thought Defusion exercise."}, {"text": " Letting go of the distracting thoughts will allow you to refocus your attention on your breathing and help you further calm yourself.

Exercise: Mindful Awareness of Emotions This is the second exercise that will help you learn to separate your thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations."}, {"text": " Mindful awareness of your emotions starts with focusing on your breathing\u2014just noticing the air moving in through your nose and out through your mouth, filling and emptying your lungs. Then, after four or five slow, long breaths, shift your attention to how you feel emotionally in the present moment."}, {"text": " Start by simply noticing if you feel good or bad.

Sometimes shame is intertwined with loss or resentment."}, {"text": " Also notice the strength of your emotion and check to see how it changes while you watch it. Emotions invariably come as a wave. They escalate, then they reach a crest, and finally they diminish. You can observe this, describing to yourself each point in the wave as the feeling grows and passes. If you have difficulty finding an emotion that you\u2019re feeling in the present moment, you can still do this exercise by locating a feeling that you had in the recent past."}, {"text": " Think back to a situation during the last several weeks when you had a strong emotion. Visualize the event\u2014where you were, what was happening, what you said, how you felt. Keep recalling details of the scene until the emotion you had then is being felt again by you right now. However you choose to observe an emotion, once the emotion is clearly recognized, stay with it."}, {"text": " Keep describing to yourself the changes in quality, intensity, or type of emotion you are feeling. Ideally, you should observe the feeling until it has significantly changed\u2014in quality or strength\u2014and you have some sense of the wave effect of your emotion. While watching your feeling, you\u2019ll also notice thoughts, sensations, and other distractions that try to pull your attention away."}, {"text": " This is normal. Just do your best to bring your focus back to your emotion whenever your attention wanders. Just stay with it until you\u2019ve watched long enough to observe your emotion grow, change, and diminish. As you learn to mindfully observe a feeling, two important realizations can emerge. One is the awareness that all feelings have a natural life span."}, {"text": " If you keep watching your emotions, they will peak and gradually subside. The second awareness is that the mere act of describing your feelings can give you a degree of control over them. Describing your emotions often has the effect of building a container around them, which keeps them from overwhelming you."}, {"text": " Read the instructions before beginning the exercise to familiarize yourself with the experience.

Each of these exercises builds on the one before it."}, {"text": "  WISE MIND As stated in the last chapter, wise mind is the ability to make healthy decisions about your life based on both your rational thoughts and your emotions. This sounds easy to do, but let\u2019s consider the traps that many people often fall into. For example, Leo was a successful salesman with a new company."}, {"text": " He had a happy family and a fairly good future ahead of himself. However, Leo frequently became upset when he couldn\u2019t close a deal, and so he often felt depressed and thought of himself as a person who would never be able to fully succeed in his life. Despite the positive feedback he received from his supervisors, Leo couldn\u2019t shake the feelings of failure that came from deals he couldn\u2019t close."}, {"text": " As a result, a few months after starting his job, Leo quit, just like he had quit similar jobs in the past. He went on to take a new job, but similar feelings of failure followed him wherever he went, and he never felt fully satisfied with himself. Similarly, Takeesha was a popular college professor who always received high ratings from her students and other faculty members."}, {"text": " But after a few unsuccessful personal relationships, Takeesha felt very lonely. She eventually stopped trying to meet new people because she anticipated that those relationships would just end in failure too. As a result, she felt unworthy of anyone\u2019s love and resigned herself to spend the rest of her life living alone."}, {"text": " Unfortunately, both Leo and Takeesha were overcome by what dialectical behavior therapy calls emotion mind (Linehan, 1993a). Emotion mind occurs when you make judgments or decisions based solely on how you feel. But keep in mind that emotions themselves are not bad or problematic. We all need emotions to live healthy lives."}, {"text": " (You\u2019ll learn more about the role of emotions in chapters 6 and 7.) The problems associated with emotion mind develop when your emotions control your life. This trap is especially dangerous for people with overwhelming emotions because emotion mind distorts your thoughts and judgments and then these distortions make it hard to formulate healthy decisions about your life."}, {"text": " Consider what happened to Leo and Takeesha: despite their \u00adsuccesses, their emotions overwhelmed their lives and led them to make unhealthy decisions. The balancing counterpart to emotion mind is reasonable mind (Linehan, 1993a). Reasonable mind is the part of your decision-making process that analyses the facts of a situation, thinks clearly about what is happening, considers the details, and then makes rational decisions."}, {"text": " Obviously, rational thinking helps us solve problems and make decisions every day. But again, as with emotions, too much rational thinking can also be a problem. We all know the story of the very intelligent person who didn\u2019t know how to express his or her emotions and, as a result, lived a very lonely life."}, {"text": " So here too a balance is needed in order to live a fulfilling, healthy life. But for people with overwhelming emotions, balancing feelings and rational thought is often hard to do.  86\u2003\u2003The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook  \fThe solution is to use wise mind to make healthy decisions about your life."}, {"text": " Wise mind results from using both emotion mind and reasonable mind together (Linehan, 1993a). Wise mind is a balance between feelings and rational thoughts. Again, let\u2019s consider the examples of Leo and Takeesha. Both of them were being controlled by their emotion minds. If Leo had been making decisions with wise mind, before quitting his job he would have balanced his decision with reasonable mind."}, {"text": " He should have reminded himself of the facts of the situation: he was already a successful salesman, and he only became upset when he couldn\u2019t close a deal. Therefore, was it reasonable that he should quit? Definitely not. What about Takeesha? She received great feedback from both her students and fellow faculty members."}, {"text": " So was it reasonable to stop meeting new people after a few failed relationships? Definitely not. This is why using wise mind is so important. You can develop wise mind by using the mindfulness skills you have already been practicing in chapter 3. Remember that part of what these exercises did was to help you recognize and separate your thoughts from your emotions."}, {"text": " So you\u2019ve already been using both your emotion mind and reasonable mind. And by practicing those mindfulness skills even more, it will become easier to make healthy decisions based on a balance of what your emotions and your rational thoughts tell you.  WISE MIND AND INTUITION According to dialectical behavior therapy, wise mind is similar to intuition (Linehan, 1993b)."}, {"text": " Often, both intuition and wise mind are described as \u201cfeelings\u201d that come from \u201cthe gut\u201d or the stomach area. The exercise that follows will help you get more in touch with your gut feelings, both physically and mentally. This exercise will help you locate the center of wise mind in your body."}, {"text": " This is the spot from which many people report making sensible, wise-mind decisions about their lives. Interestingly, this phenomenon of gut feelings might be supported by scientific evidence. Researchers have discovered that a vast web of nerves covers the area of the stomach. This web of nerves is second in complexity only to the human brain, so some researchers have referred to this area as the enteric brain, meaning the brain in the stomach."}, {"text": "  Exercise: Wise-Mind Meditation When you begin using this technique, set a kitchen timer or an alarm clock for three to five minutes and practice this exercise until the alarm goes off. Then, as you get more accustomed to using this technique, you can set the alarm for longer periods of time, like ten or fifteen minutes."}, {"text": " If you feel more comfortable listening to the instructions, use an audio-recording device to record the directions in a slow, even voice so that you can listen to them while practicing this technique.

If you feel comfortable closing your eyes, do so to help you relax. Now locate the bottom of your sternum on your rib cage. You can do this by touching the bone at the center of your chest and then following it down toward your abdomen until the bone ends. Now place one hand on your abdomen between the bottom of your sternum and your belly button."}, {"text": " This is the center of wise mind. Take a few slow, long breaths and relax.

If you\u2019ve had any troubling thoughts, problems, or decisions that you have to make in your life, think about them for a few seconds."}, {"text": " Then ask your center of wise mind what you should do about these problems or decisions. Ask your inner intuitive self for guidance, and then notice what thoughts or solutions arise out of your center of wise mind. Don\u2019t judge whatever answers you receive. Just note them to yourself and keep breathing."}, {"text": " Continue to focus your attention on your center of wise mind. If no thoughts or answers come to your questions, just continue breathing. Now continue to notice your breath rising and falling. Keep breathing and returning your focus to the center of wise mind until the timer goes off. Then when you\u2019ve finished, slowly open your eyes and return your focus to the room."}, {"text": "  HOW TO MAKE WISE-MIND DECISIONS Now that you\u2019ve had practice locating your wise-mind center, you can \u201ccheck in\u201d with that area of your body before you make decisions. This can help you determine if a decision is a good one. To do this, simply think about the action you are about to take and focus your attention on your center of wise mind."}, {"text": " Then consider what your wise mind tells you. Does your decision feel like a good one? If so, then maybe you should do it. If it doesn\u2019t feel like a good decision, then maybe you should consider some other options.  88\u2003\u2003The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook  \fLearning to make reliably good decisions about your life is a process that evolves as long as you are alive, and there is no single way to do this."}, {"text": " Checking in with your center of wise mind is simply one way that often works for some people. However, some words of caution are needed here. When you first use wise mind to make decisions about your life, it will probably be difficult to tell the difference between an intuitive gut feeling and a decision made the old way with emotion mind."}, {"text": " The difference can be determined in three ways: 1.\t  When you made your decision were you being mindful of both your emotions and the facts of the situation? In other words, did you make the decision based on both emotion mind and reasonable mind? If you haven\u2019t considered the facts of the situation and are being controlled by your emotions, you\u2019re not using wise mind."}, {"text": " Sometimes we need to let our emotions settle and \u201ccool off\u201d before we can make a good decision. If you\u2019ve recently been involved in a very emotional situation, either good or bad, give yourself enough time for your hot emotions to cool down so that you can use reasonable mind.  2.\t  Did the decision \u201cfeel\u201d right to you? Before you make a decision, check in with your center of wise mind and notice how it feels."}, {"text": " If you check in with your center of wise mind and you feel nervous, maybe the decision you\u2019re about to make isn\u2019t a good one or a safe one. However, maybe you feel nervous because you\u2019re excited about doing something new, which can be a good thing. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to tell the difference, and that\u2019s why using reasonable mind to make your decision is also important."}, {"text": " Later, when you have more experience making healthy decisions for your life, it will be easier to tell the difference between a good nervous feeling and a bad nervous feeling.  3.\t  You can sometimes tell if you\u2019ve used wise mind by examining the results of your decision. If your decision leads to beneficial results for your life, chances are you used wise mind to make that decision."}, {"text": " When you start using wise mind, keep track of your decisions and the results in order to determine if you\u2019re really using wise mind. Remember, wise mind should help you make healthy decisions about your life.  RADICAL ACCEPTANCE Another very important part of wise mind, and mindfulness in general, is a skill called radical acceptance (Linehan, 1993a)."}, {"text": " (You already explored radical acceptance in chapter 2, Advanced Distress Tolerance Skills, but the following description will help you understand how it relates to mindfulness skills.) Radical acceptance means tolerating something without judging it or trying to change it. Remember the definition of mindfulness that we gave you in the last chapter? Mindfulness is the ability to be aware of your thoughts, emotions, physical sensations, and actions\u2014in the present moment\u2014without judging or criticizing yourself or your experience."}, {"text": " Radical acceptance is a very important piece of being mindful because if you\u2019re judging yourself, your experience, or someone else in the present moment, then you\u2019re not really paying attention to what\u2019s happening  Advanced Mindfulness Skills\u2003\u2003 89  \fin that moment. In many ways, judgment is the royal road to suffering, because when you judge others you get angry and when you judge yourself you get depressed."}, {"text": " So in order to be truly mindful in the present moment, and in order to be fully centered in wise mind, you must practice being nonjudgmental. Radical acceptance might sound like a difficult skill to master, but it\u2019s definitely worth the effort. Consider this example. Thomas struggled with a problem that\u2019s very common for people with overwhelming emotions."}, {"text": " He divided everyone and everything into two categories: they were either all good or all bad. There was no in-between for him. When people treated him nicely, they were good, but when someone disagreed with him, he considered them to be bad, even if the person had just been on his good side a few minutes before."}, {"text": " This quick fluctuation between good and bad led Thomas to make a lot of judgments and critical remarks about himself and others. Over the years, the accumulation of fluctuations and judgments made Thomas very sensitive to situations that could go wrong. He always expected that other people would make mistakes, insult him, or betray him in some way."}, {"text": " One time his sister said that she couldn\u2019t help him take his car to the repair shop, and Thomas blew up at her. He criticized her for being ungrateful and selfish. However, the truth was that she had to take her own daughter to the doctor, but Thomas never heard her reasoning. He was too wrapped up in his own judgmental thinking to really listen to anyone else."}, {"text": " In truth, Thomas had created a pattern in his life where all of his judgments and critical thinking became realities, and this led to a very lonely and distressing life. When Thomas was finally introduced to the skill of radical acceptance, he was critical of it too. \u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d he thought, \u201cThis stupid idea isn\u2019t going to help me."}, {"text": " I don\u2019t need this. How can anyone not be critical?\u201d But with the urging of his family, Thomas decided to try using radical acceptance. At first, it was very difficult for him to not make judgments about himself and other people, but he continued using the exercises in this workbook, and, with practice, radical acceptance became easier."}, {"text": " Slowly his thinking began to change. Thomas spent less time obsessing over judgmental thoughts and critical remarks, and he spent less time anticipating that other people would insult or betray him. He also no longer thought of people as either just good or bad. He began to recognize that everyone makes mistakes, and that\u2019s okay."}, {"text": " He also became more mindful of his thoughts, feelings, sensations, and actions in the present moment, which helped him focus better on his daily experiences and make healthier choices for his life. As you can see from this example, one of the hardest parts of using radical acceptance is recognizing when you\u2019re being judgmental of yourself or others."}, {"text": " This takes practice, and the skills in the workbook will help. But recognizing when you\u2019re being judgmental also takes time. You\u2019re going to make mistakes. When you\u2019re first learning to be nonjudgmental, there will be times when you will be judgmental. Then you\u2019ll recognize what you\u2019re doing, and you\u2019ll be further critical of yourself for being judgmental."}, {"text": " But that\u2019s okay too. That\u2019s part of the learning process. Learning how to use radical acceptance is a lot like the story of a man who\u2019s walking down a city street and falls through an open manhole to the sewer. He climbs out, looks in the hole, and says, \u201cI better not do that again.\u201d But the next day, walking down the same street, he steps into the same open manhole, climbs out, and says, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I did it again."}, {"text": "\u201d Then on the third day, he\u2019s about to step into the same open manhole when he suddenly remembers what happened on the two previous days, so he avoids the fall. On the fourth day, the man remembers to walk around the  90\u2003\u2003The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook  \fopen manhole as soon as he starts walking down that street."}, {"text": " And on the fifth day, he chooses to walk down a different street in order to avoid the problem completely. Obviously, learning how to use radical acceptance will take you longer than five days, but the process of falling into the same judgmental traps will happen in a very similar way. Below are several exercises to help you develop a nonjudgmental attitude and to use the skill of radical acceptance."}, {"text": " But before you start, let\u2019s clarify radical acceptance a little more, because it can often be a confusing concept for many people. To use radical acceptance does not mean that you silently put up with potentially harmful or dangerous situations in your life. For example, if you are in a violent or abusive relationship and you need to get out, then get out."}, {"text": " Don\u2019t put yourself in harm\u2019s way and simply tolerate whatever happens to you. Radical acceptance is a skill that is supposed to help you live a healthier life; it is not a tool to fill your life with more suffering. However, there\u2019s no doubt that it will be tough to start using radical acceptance because it will require you to think about yourself, your life, and other people in a new way."}, {"text": " But once you start using radical acceptance, you\u2019ll find that it actually gives you more freedom. You\u2019ll no longer spend as much time judging yourself and others, and so you\u2019ll be free to do many other things instead. Radical acceptance is one of the most important tools to learn in dialectical behavior therapy, and it\u2019s definitely worth the effort."}, {"text": "  Exercise: Negative Judgments The first step to changing a problem is to recognize when that problem occurs. So to begin changing your judgmental thinking, the first step is to recognize when you\u2019re being judgmental and critical. On page 87 is a Negative Judgments Record. For the next week, do your best to keep track of all the negative judgments and criticisms that you make."}, {"text": " This includes those you make about things you read in the newspaper or see on television, judgments you make about yourself and other people, and so on. Make photocopies of the Negative Judgments Record if you need to, and keep one folded in your pocket so that you can record your judgments as soon as you recognize that you\u2019re making them."}, {"text": " If you decide that you\u2019re only going to write down your negative judgments once a day, such as before you go to sleep, the process of learning radical acceptance will take longer. At the end of the day, you might forget many of the negative judgments that you\u2019ve made. In order to remind yourself to write down your negative judgments, it might help to give yourself visual reminders."}, {"text": " Some people have found that wearing something special to remind them, like a new ring or a bracelet, prods their memories to write down their judgments. Other people put up sticky notes around their home and office with the word \u201cjudgments\u201d written on them. Use whatever works best for you. Do this exercise for at least one week, or until you recognize that you\u2019re starting to catch yourself in the moment when you\u2019re making negative judgments."}, {"text": " Keep track of when you made the judgment, where you were, and what the negative judgment was.

In the previous exercise, you focused on recognizing your negative judgments because they are usually the easiest ones to spot. But positive judgments can also be problematic."}, {"text": " Remember the example of Thomas we recently gave you? He divided everyone into two categories: either all good or all bad. He liked people when they were good, but when they did something to upset him, he got angry and labeled them \u201cbad.\u201d So do you see how making even positive judgments about people or things can be problematic? When you think of someone (or something) with a rigid and predetermined idea of how that person is going to treat you, then it\u2019s easy to become disappointed, because no one (and nothing) is perfect."}, {"text": " Presidents sometimes lie, religious people sometimes gamble, things that we like sometimes break, and people we trust sometimes hurt us. As a result, when you put someone into a category of being 100 percent good, trustworthy, saintly, wholesome, or honest, it\u2019s very easy to get disappointed. But this doesn\u2019t mean that you should never trust anyone."}, {"text": " What radical acceptance says is that you should approach people and situations in your life without judging them to be good or bad, positive or negative. In some forms of meditation, this is called beginner\u2019s mind (Suzuki, 2001). This means that you should enter every situation and every relationship as if you were seeing it for the very first time."}, {"text": " This reoccurring newness prevents you from bringing any old judgments (good or bad) into the present moment, which allows you to stay more mindful. Plus, by keeping the situation fresh, it also helps you stay in better control of your emotions.

It\u2019s true that they all express some kind of emotion, such as anger, distress, and sadness. But more importantly, they\u2019re all judgments of the other person. Each of the statements blames the other person for the way the speaker feels. Now consider how you would feel if someone said one of these statements to you."}, {"text": " What would you do? Maybe you would say something just as angry back to the person, which would lead to a big fight. The result would be that nothing gets resolved. Or maybe you would just shut down emotionally, stop listening, or walk away. Again, nothing would get resolved. Judgmental statements like these stop any form of effective communication."}, {"text": " So what can you do instead? One of the solutions is to turn \u201cyou\u201d statements into mindful \u201cI\u201d statements. \u000e\u000e  Mindful \u201cI\u201d statements are based on your own mindful awareness of how you feel.  \u000e\u000e  Mindful \u201cI\u201d statements are a more accurate description of how you feel.  \u000e\u000e  Mindful \u201cI\u201d statements let a person know how you feel in a nonjudgmental way."}, {"text": "  \u000e\u000e  Mindful \u201cI\u201d statements evoke greater empathy and understanding from the other person, which allows the person to meet your needs.  Let\u2019s look at the four previous examples and turn them from \u201cyou\u201d statements into mindful \u201cI\u201d statements. Instead of saying \u201cYou make me mad,\u201d say \u201cRight now, I feel very mad."}, {"text": "\u201d Doesn\u2019t that sound less judgmental and blaming? If someone said the alternative statement to you (\u201cI feel very mad\u201d), wouldn\u2019t you be more willing to discuss the situation? Wouldn\u2019t you feel less angry? Look at the second sentence. Instead of saying \u201cYou\u2019re such a jerk, I could scream,\u201d say \u201cI feel so angry right now I could scream."}, {"text": "\u201d Do you hear the difference it makes to change a \u201cyou\u201d statement into an \u201cI\u201d statement?

So an alternative mindful \u201cI\u201d statement could be \u201cI feel upset when you ignore me.\u201d In the seventh sentence, the speaker might feel many things. Usually, when you ask someone to stop doing something, it\u2019s because the action hurts."}, {"text": " So maybe the speaker feels hurt, and an alternative mindful \u201cI\u201d statement could be \u201cI feel hurt when you do that.\u201d The eighth sentence is trickier. The speaker calls the other person some insulting expletive. This also usually indicates that the speaker\u2019s feelings have been hurt.

For example, you\u2019re probably not comfortable making statements like the ones you made in the last exercise, where you speak directly to the other person about how you feel."}, {"text": " But sometimes in order to get what you want, you have to modify what you feel like  104\u2003\u2003The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook  \fdoing, especially if you struggle with overwhelming emotions.

Both of you are yelling. You feel so hurt and upset that you think about walking out the door and ending the relationship. But in the back of your mind, you also recognize that this is the best relationship you\u2019ve had in a long time, and you wish that it would work out."}, {"text": " So, instead of leaving, you take a deep breath and use mindful \u201cI\u201d statements to let your partner know how you\u2019re feeling.  \u000e\u000e  Your boss gives you a new task even though you\u2019re already burdened with more work than you have time for.

This is why mindfulness is such an important part of doing what\u2019s effective.

The problem is remembering to do it! We forget all the time. It is not hard, but we just do not remember to do it.\u201d So how should you remember to be mindful?

After reading these two chapters, Loretta began approaching many of her tasks mindfully."}, {"text": " At night, she would even brush her teeth mindfully. First, she focused her attention on how the toothbrush felt in her hand and how the tube felt as she squeezed out the paste. She was also aware of how her body felt, standing in front of the bathroom mirror, and how the weight of her body felt as she stood in front of the sink."}, {"text": " Then, as she began to brush, she became aware of the taste in her mouth, the feel of the bristles on her gums, and the movement of her arm as she brushed. When distracting thoughts arose, such as things she did earlier in the day, she imagined the thoughts floating down a river on a leaf. If judgments arose about people she knew, she did the same thing and watched the judgments float away."}, {"text": " Then she continued to shift her focus every few moments to her breathing, feeling it rise and fall. Loretta did a good job being as aware as possible of simply brushing her teeth in that moment. At other times throughout the day, she had  108\u2003\u2003The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook  \fsimilar experiences with other activities."}, {"text": " When she washed the dishes, she paid attention to how the water felt and to the smell of the dish soap. While she was cooking, she was very aware of the heat from the stove, the sensation of hunger in her stomach, the sound of the water boiling, and her distracting judgments, which usually concerned whether or not her husband would like the meal."}, {"text": " She did her best to let those judgments go and to be as fully present in the moment of cooking as she could be. Similarly, Scott did his best to be mindful throughout the day. As he walked, he focused his attention on how his feet felt as they touched the pavement. Sometimes, he was even aware of how his feet felt moving in his socks."}, {"text": " Then he would shift his focus to what he was seeing. He visually scanned what was around him as he walked, and he made mental notes to himself: \u201cRight now, I\u2019m seeing a woman, a tree, a building,\u201d and so on. When distracting thoughts arose, he imagined the thoughts coming in one door and leaving through another."}, {"text": " If he saw someone on the street whom he didn\u2019t like and judgments arose, he would also let those judgments go. Similarly, if positive judgments arose about people or places he liked, he did his best to let those go too. For example, once he caught himself thinking \u201cOh look, there\u2019s Mike. He\u2019s the guy that loaned me twenty dollars that time."}, {"text": " He\u2019s the greatest guy in the world. I wish I could be more like him.\u201d Scott knew that he couldn\u2019t stop those judgments from arising, but instead of getting stuck on them, he would let them go. And if the judgments came back, he would let them go again. But clearly, the greatest challenge to using mindfulness skills is when you are interacting with someone else."}, {"text": " Talking or arguing with someone and being mindful at the same time is often difficult.

Naturally, judgments about Laura came up while Claire was driving, and she did her best to just let them go."}, {"text": " However, some judgments were easier to let go of than others. When they got to the shopping mall, Claire also had opportunities to use radical acceptance. There were certain stores she liked and certain stores she didn\u2019t like. At first, she was positive that she would find the \u201cperfect\u201d dress in the store she really liked because they always had the \u201cbest\u201d clothes."}, {"text": " But quickly, Claire recognized the positive judgments she was making, and she let them go. That was lucky too, because none of the stores she liked had the dress she was looking for. In the past, she would have been crushed and gotten upset. But because of radical acceptance, her neutrality and her nonjudgmental attitude allowed her to cope with the situation in a healthier way."}, {"text": " Later, the two women found themselves in a higher-end store looking at dresses that were more expensive than what Claire could afford. However, both she and Laura found a dress that  Advanced Mindfulness Skills\u2003\u2003 109  \fthey loved. Immediately, Laura began pressuring Claire to buy it. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about how much it costs,\u201d Laura said."}, {"text": " Claire looked at herself in the mirror and fell in love with the dress, regardless of the price tag. Claire was about to buy the dress when she remembered to use wise mind to help her make her decision. Her emotion mind loved the dress, but her reasonable mind reminded her that she already had a hefty credit card bill and this dress was far too expensive."}, {"text": " In the dressing room, Claire took a few slow, deep breaths and put her hand on her center of wise mind. Her abdomen felt very nervous, not happy and excited. Instantly, she knew it was a very bad idea to buy the expensive dress, so she gave it back to the salesclerk and left the store. Claire was proud of herself for making the right decision, but the drama didn\u2019t end there."}, {"text": " Laura began making fun of Claire for being \u201ctoo cheap\u201d to buy the dress. Again, Claire\u2019s mind began to fill with judgments about Laura. She did her best to let them go, but as Laura continued to ridicule her, Claire\u2019s only goal became leaving the mall and dropping Laura at home. Internally, Claire wanted to scream at Laura, but she knew that would end up in a big fight."}, {"text": " Claire thought about doing what was effective in that moment. She knew that she just had to get home as quickly and safely as possible without getting into a fight that she might later regret. Claire drove home silently, listening to Laura\u2019s criticisms. She was relieved when she finally let Laura off at her house."}, {"text": " Later, when Claire was feeling less angry, she even found the courage to call Laura to discuss what happened.

Unfortunately, there is no shortcut to becoming instantaneously and permanently mindful."}, {"text": " But as Dr. Charles Tart said, learning how to be mindful isn\u2019t a strenuous activity; you simply have to remember to do it.

RESISTANCES AND HINDRANCES TO MINDFULNESS PRACTICE It is common to encounter inner resistance and difficulties as you practice mindfulness and develop skills."}, {"text": " What many people do not know is that there are some hindrances to mindfulness that are so common that they have been recognized by meditation teachers and practitioners for thousands of years! This final section of the chapter will help you identify five common hindrances to mindfulness meditation and suggest ways you can work skillfully with each one."}, {"text": "  The Five Hindrances Desire, aversion, sleepiness, restlessness, and doubt are the five hindrances long recognized as common obstacles to meditation (and mindfulness) practice. These energies appear as obstacles when they take you out of the present moment or cause you to become lost in thoughts and feelings that interfere with your mindfulness practice of observing accurately and without judgment."}, {"text": " However, they do not have to be obstacles. In truth, they can become your wisest teachers if you are willing to recognize, observe, and learn from them. \u000e\u000e  Desire refers to the wish for things to be different\u2014right now! This can be a wish for a different sense experience (to \u201cfeel better\u201d or \u201cfeel happy or peaceful,\u201d for example) or to become someone or something different than what you experience yourself as now (become the \u201cperfect person\u201d or \u201cperfect meditator,\u201d for example)."}, {"text": "  \u000e\u000e  Aversion means having anger for or ill will toward what is here. Aversion includes other forms of resistance to present-moment experience, such as feeling bored or afraid. Often, the very activity of judgment or judgmental thinking is an \u00adexpression of aversion.   WEEKLY MINDFULNESS ACTIVITIES RECORD  Other Mindful Exercise  \f\u000e\u000e  Sleepiness means just that\u2014feeling sleepy, heavy, and dull."}, {"text": " It is important to note that the causes of sleepiness can include physical fatigue, but, also, a second kind of sleepiness is actually a resistance to something happening in mind and body that may be frightening or painful. Learning to distinguish between these two is very helpful.  \u000e\u000e  Restlessness is the opposite of sleepy."}, {"text": " It can be very uncomfortable. It is a \u201cstorm\u201d of thoughts, feelings, and sensations that demand movement and are quite distracting.  \u000e\u000e  Doubt is that inner voice that says, \u201cI can\u2019t handle this. I don\u2019t know how to do it. What good is this? This definitely is not for me.\u201d Doubt is often expressed as words in your mind and feelings of fear and resistance to what is happening."}, {"text": "  Working Wisely with the Hindrances The first and most potent way to handle any of the hindrances is to make the experience of the hindrance itself a focus for your mindfulness. Acknowledge what is happening without fighting it. Gently place attention on desire, aversion, sleepiness, restlessness, or doubt, and look deeply, allowing the energy to reveal itself in all of its forms."}, {"text": " Patiently return your soft and curious attention time and again, as often as necessary, to the hindrance energy, naming it and learning what it has to teach you. The lessons can come in many ways, including thoughts, memories, feelings, and body sensations. In addition, you may find benefits in the following specific suggestions for each hindrance: \u000e\u000e  For desire, recall that no matter how many times you get what you desire, you always want more."}, {"text": " Let this wisdom empower you to resist the temptation of desire and learn from it instead. Keep noticing and naming desire without acting on it.  \u000e\u000e  For aversion, recognize anger and ill will as some of your strongest teachers. Resolve to learn from them. At times, it also helps if you can work to balance them by developing thoughts of compassion, kindness, and forgiveness."}, {"text": "  \u000e\u000e  For sleepiness, know it as a powerful condition that demands your full attention. It can help to sit up straight, even stand. Splash water on your face. Take a break and do something active, walking mindfully, for example.  \u000e\u000e  For restlessness, besides making it the object of mindfulness, it can be very helpful to sharpen your concentration."}, {"text": " Take a more narrow or smaller focus, for example, placing attention at the tip of your nose for practicing mindful breathing, or relaxing and counting your breaths from one to ten and back to one until the restlessness subsides.  Advanced Mindfulness Skills\u2003\u2003 113  \f\u000e\u000e  For doubt, especially when your mind is racing everywhere, it can help to concentrate attention in the present moment with some resolve and steadiness."}, {"text": " Other remedies for doubt can be conversation with mindfulness teachers and others who follow this path, and inspirational readings related to how others handle doubt.  Finally, remember to take a kind and interested nonjudging attitude toward the hindrances when they appear. When you can treat them as teachers, not obstacles, they will cease to be hindrances!  114\u2003\u2003The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook  \fCHAPTER 5  Exploring Mindfulness Further  MINDFULNESS AND MEDITATION The mindfulness skills that are at the core of the dialectical behavior therapy approach are actually linked directly to a much larger and more ancient tradition of meditation."}, {"text": " In that larger tradition is a significant body of experience and wisdom related to developing and practicing mindfulness. This experience and wisdom has much to offer anyone interested in mindfulness, whether they seek improved psychological or physical health, personal enrichment, or even spiritual growth."}, {"text": " This chapter invites you to explore mindfulness further by trying some additional practices adapted from the ancient tradition of meditation and now appearing in many clinical settings that teach mindfulness-based approaches for a variety of health-related conditions. The intention and hope is that you will develop an even deeper appreciation for the power of mindfulness to support you, promote your happiness, and lead you increasingly to rest in wise mind."}, {"text": " Marsha Linehan, who developed dialectical behavior therapy, has noted this larger context for mindfulness in commenting that the mindfulness skills central to dialectical behavior therapy are \u201cpsychological and behavioral versions of meditation practices from Eastern spiritual training.\u201d Linehan goes on to say that in developing dialectical behavior therapy, \u201cI have drawn most heavily from the practice of Zen, but the skills are compatible with most Western contemplative and Eastern meditation practices\u201d (Linehan, 1993b, p."}, {"text": " 63). In the past twenty-five years or so, many health care professionals have become interested in mindfulness and its applications in treating a wide variety of health-related conditions ranging from stress to chronic pain to anxiety and depression to cancer. In bringing mindfulness forward in Western health care settings, the ancient teachings and wisdom of various contemplative and meditative traditions have provided much valuable insight."}, {"text": "  \fAlthough many (like Linehan) have drawn upon these older traditions for guidance, the actual practices used for purposes of health and healing do not require adherence to any specific faith or religious beliefs, nor do they carry any specific cultural requirements. The practice of mindfulness is truly something for all human beings."}, {"text": " The practices you will find in this chapter also apply equally to any interested person. First, you will learn about the role of \u201cheartful\u201d qualities of kindness and compassion and how they are actually embedded attitudes in any activity of mindfulness. Next, you will learn how mindfulness can deepen, breath by breath in the present moment, by attention to and the support of the dimensions of spaciousness and stillness."}, {"text": " Kindness, compassion, spaciousness, and stillness\u2014this chapter invites you to bring attention more consciously to these qualities and discover their power to support and deepen your practice of mindfulness.  ENHANCING YOUR MINDFULNESS SKILLS USING KINDNESS AND COMPASSION In dialectical behavior therapy, a core \u201chow\u201d skill is being nonjudgmental."}, {"text": " In mindfulness-based stress reduction, a mindfulness approach to stress reduction developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn and others, nonjudging is the first of seven attitudes considered to be the foundation of mindfulness practice. The others are patience, beginner\u2019s mind, trust, non-striving, acceptance, and letting go (KabatZinn, 1990, p."}, {"text": " 33). Yet you may have noticed that it is not always so easy to be nonjudging. In fact, the habits of judging and criticizing are deeply ingrained in nearly everyone, for a wide variety of reasons. Because of this deep-habit energy of judging, meditation teachers have long taught the importance of building a foundation for mindfulness upon attitudes of kindness and compassion."}, {"text": " For example, the well-respected meditation teacher Christina Feldman has observed that \u201cattention, awareness, understanding, and compassion form the basic skeleton of all systems of meditation.\u201d She goes on to say, \u201cCompassion is a fundamental principle of meditation. Meditation is not a narcissistic, self-interested path."}, {"text": " It provides the foundation for love, integrity, compassion, respect and sensitivity\u201d (Feldman, 1998, p. 2). In recent years, health psychologists have begun to look more deeply at \u201cpositive\u201d emotions and attitudes and their role in promoting health. The rich tradition of positive mental health inquiry builds on the work of psychologists Gordon Allport and Abraham Maslow in the 1960s and continues strongly today."}, {"text": " It is motivated in large part by an interest in developing an expanded vision of human capacity and potential. Of particular interest on this theme is that expanded human potential has been one of the primary goals of meditation training since ancient times. Contemporary health psychologists and researchers Shauna L."}, {"text": " Shapiro and Gary E. R. Schwartz have written about the positive aspects of meditation. They point out that mindfulness is about how one pays attention. In addition to the seven attitudinal qualities identified by KabatZinn, Shapiro and Schwartz suggest that an additional five qualities be incorporated to address the  116\u2003\u2003The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook  \faffective (or \u201cheart\u201d) dimension of mindfulness."}, {"text": " The five \u201cheart\u201d qualities they name are: gratitude, gentleness, generosity, empathy, and lovingkindness (Shapiro & Schwartz, 2000, pp. 253\u2013273). Lovingkindness deserves special mention. It has been popularized by the meditation teacher Sharon Salzberg (1995; 1997; 2005). As health-care professionals learn more about lovingkindness, this form of meditation is gaining popularity in a variety of health-care settings as a meditation practice that supports mindfulness and also carries healing potential of its own."}, {"text": " Lovingkindness is variously described as deep friendliness and welcoming or as a quality embodying compassion and cherishing, filled with forgiveness and unconditional love. It is a deep human capacity, always present, at least potentially. It can be seen when one observes a mother tenderly caring for her child."}, {"text": " Lovingkindness can be a powerful aid to your mindfulness practice. All you need to do is to admit and allow feelings of kindness and compassion into your way of paying attention mindfully. Resting in kindness this way, with compassion and affection embedded in your attention, can protect you from the deep habits of judging and criticism and support you in the \u201chow\u201d dialectical behavior therapy skill of being truly nonjudgmental."}, {"text": "  Exercise: Meditation Practice for the Lovingkindness of Yourself and Others The following is a brief meditation practice to cultivate lovingkindness for yourself and for others. Practice it whenever and for as long as you like. Try it as a \u201clead-in\u201d to any of your formal mindfulness practices."}, {"text": "  Instructions Take a comfortable position. Bring your focus mindfully to your breath or body for a few breaths. Open and soften as much as feels safe to you as you allow yourself to connect with your natural inner feelings of kindness and compassion for others. Now shift your attention to yourself."}, {"text": " It could be a sense of your whole self or some part that needs care and attention, such as a physical injury or the site of an illness or a feeling of emotional pain. Imagine speaking gently and quietly to yourself, as a mother speaks to her frightened or injured child.

It may help to practice for just a few minutes at a time at first and later build up to a longer practice.  Exploring Mindfulness Further\u2003\u2003 117  \fWhen you like, you can shift your attention and focus to a friend or someone you know who is troubled. You can also focus on groups of people, such as \u201call my friends\u201d or \u201call my brothers and sisters."}, {"text": "\u201d When you wish, you can experiment with difficult people in your life. Try sending them kindness and your wish that they might be happy, and watch your inner response. In doing lovingkindness for a difficult person, you are not allowing them to abuse or hurt you but are making an attempt to see that they, too, are human beings who seek happiness."}, {"text": " This can change your relationship to the situation and release you from resentment you may be holding. Please note that in doing lovingkindness meditation, you are likely to experience many \u00addifferent feelings! Some may even be disturbing, such as sadness, grief, or anger. If this happens, you have not made a mistake."}, {"text": " It is common for deeply held feelings to be released as one practices lovingkindness. This release is actually a kind of healing in itself. Just pay attention to all of your feelings, honoring each one, and continue your practice.  ATTENTION TO SPACIOUSNESS AND STILLNESS DEEPENS MINDFULNESS The core dialectical behavior therapy skill of mindfulness includes the \u201cwhat\u201d skill of observing and the \u201chow\u201d skill of nonjudging."}, {"text": " But old habits of attention can often make it difficult to observe fully or to really be nonjudging. When it seems especially difficult to be mindful, observe closely, or be nonjudging, you simply may not be relaxing enough or resting in your wholeness. Instead, you are very likely overly identified with some active and present smaller part or parts of yourself."}, {"text": " Meditation teachers often use the metaphor of an ocean when illustrating your wholeness compared to identification with a smaller part of yourself (your thoughts and judgments or your feelings of anger or fear, for example). In this metaphor, it is noted that the waves and the ocean are not separate."}, {"text": " Although the waves are varied and can be intense and dramatic, they still are made of water and are part of the greater ocean, even down to the deepest depths. It is said that your wholeness (sometimes called big mind or some similar term) is like the ocean, while the parts (feelings, thoughts, stories in your mind) are like the waves\u2014constantly rising and falling, \u00adappearing and disappearing, while their essence, the ocean, is always present."}, {"text": " The tendency to identify with the wave and to lose your feeling of connection with the larger ocean of who you are is very strong. Practicing mindfulness, learning to recognize the reasoning mind and the emotional mind when they arise, can offer freedom from rigid identification with your smaller parts, as you have discovered."}, {"text": " And by shifting your focus at times, on purpose, to experiences often not noticed or taken for granted, you can become much more flexible in your attention, more mindful, and more able to break the habitual identification with old habits of thinking and feeling.  118\u2003\u2003The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook  \fChoosing space and stillness (or silence) as your objects of mindfulness can be a very potent practice for gaining this flexibility and freedom from the habits of identifying with the \u201cwaves\u201d of your mind (thoughts or feelings that are deep and intense)."}, {"text": "  Exercise: Meditation Practice for Mindfulness of Space, Inside and Outside of You The following two meditation practices offer you a means to cultivate awareness of space (inner and outer) and of stillness and silence. Try these practices with a sense of curiosity and playfulness. You don\u2019t have to make anything special happen or become anyone or anything other than who you already are! In fact, it is helpful to consider the possibility that you actually already have vast spaciousness and stillness available to you (like the vast ocean depths) and all that is required is to allow space and stillness to reenter your awareness."}, {"text": " Let the spaciousness and stillness within you \u201ccome back in,\u201d so to speak. There is no work you have to do\u2014none whatsoever! Just bring kind attention to what is already here.  Instructions Take a comfortable position. Collect attention by focusing mindfully on your breath sensations for a few breaths."}, {"text": " When you feel steady and focused, widen the focus to include all sounds, letting them come to you without adding or subtracting anything. Focus on the direct experience of sound without being caught in the name or story about any sound. Practice mindfulness of breath sensations and sounds for a few more breaths."}, {"text": " Now bring your attention to the spaces between the breaths, there between in-breath and out-breath, and there, at the end of the out-breath before the next in-breath. Let your attention rest there, in the spaces between each breath. Come back to the space whenever your attention wanders. When you notice that sounds draw your attention, first notice the sound, then notice the spaces between the sounds."}, {"text": " Notice how one sound is louder, another softer, one closer, one farther, and how all have space between and around them. Notice how all the sounds exist within a larger container of space. Let your attention rest in the space that holds all the sounds, allowing them to come and go. When you wish, open your eyes."}, {"text": " Look around at what is before you. What do you see? Objects, of course, but do you see the space between the objects? Look more closely. See the space and the shape of the space between objects near and far. Can you see the vast space that holds all the objects you are viewing? Relax and look deeply."}, {"text": " Whenever you like, practice noticing space, either as a formal meditation practice (as suggested above with breath sensations, sounds, or viewed objects) or more informally, just paying attention in different situations as you go about your day.

Just let the breath sensations return to your awareness, with patience and kindness. As you practice mindfulness of your breath, you may begin to notice that a sense of inner stillness arises."}, {"text": " It may appear only in brief flashes at first, but don\u2019t be discouraged. Just let it come. Continue noticing any feelings of stillness you experience. Relax in them, and allow them to come to you. Initially, you may notice the stillness in your body as a feeling of calm and ease. Then, it will become easier to experience the stillness in your mind when your thoughts quiet down."}, {"text": " Sometimes the stillness appears more clearly as silence. When you notice any sense of silence, between sounds or between thoughts, for instance, let your attention rest there. Let it return there when it wanders. Listen carefully to all sounds as they come and go. Don\u2019t focus on any one sound, but instead focus on the silence and space between the sounds."}, {"text": " As your attention steadies, notice how the sounds arise from silence and return to silence. Let your attention rest in the silence as you listen for the next sound.  CONCLUSION In practicing mindfulness, you are joining a vast and ancient tradition, cultivated by countless human beings for thousands of years."}, {"text": " Many teachers have pointed out that practicing mindfulness includes the attitudes of kindness and compassion in the way you pay attention. As you become more mindful, a growing sense of wholeness, including spaciousness and stillness, becomes brighter and can help transform your experience of living."}, {"text": " This chapter invites you to draw upon some valuable teachings from the tradition of mindfulness meditation\u2014by focusing on kindness and compassion and spaciousness and stillness\u2014in order to discover more about your own amazing and powerful resources for healing and enriching your life.  120\u2003\u2003The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook  \fCHAPTER 6  Basic Emotion Regulation Skills  YOUR EMOTIONS: WHAT ARE THEY? To put it simply, emotions are signals within your body that tell you what\u2019s happening."}, {"text": " When something pleasurable is happening to you, you feel good; when something distressing is happening to you, you feel bad. In many ways, your emotions are like an instant news service that gives you constant updates about what you\u2019re doing and what you\u2019re experiencing. Your initial reactions to what is happening to you are called primary emotions."}, {"text": " These are strong feelings that come on quickly, that don\u2019t involve having to think about what\u2019s happening. For example, if you won a contest, you might instantaneously feel surprised. When someone you care about dies, you quickly feel sad. When someone does something that offends you, you might immediately feel angry."}, {"text": " But in addition to experiencing primary emotions, it\u2019s also possible to experience secondary emotions. These are emotional reactions to your primary emotions. Or to put it another way, secondary emotions are feelings about your feelings (Marra, 2005). Here\u2019s a simple example. Erik yelled at his sister because she did something that made him feel angry."}, {"text": " His feeling of anger came on very quickly. But a little later he felt guilty about getting so angry with her. Anger was his primary emotion, and guilt was his secondary emotion. However, it\u2019s also possible that you can experience numerous secondary emotions in response to a single primary emotion."}, {"text": " Here\u2019s a more complicated example. Shauna became anxious when she was asked to make a future presentation at work. As the day drew closer, she became depressed as she thought about how anxious she was getting, and then she started to feel worthless that she couldn\u2019t make a simple presentation. Then, the day after the presentation, she started to feel guilty that she had made such a big deal about it in the first place."}, {"text": " You can see how a person\u2019s emotions can get very complicated very quickly. Anxiety was Shauna\u2019s primary emotion, and depression, worthlessness, and guilt were all her secondary emotions in response to her anxiety.  \fIt\u2019s possible that your primary emotional reaction to a situation can set off a limitless chain reaction of distressing secondary emotions that cause you much more pain than your original emotion does."}, {"text": " For this reason, it\u2019s important that you try to identify what your original primary emotion is in a distressing situation so that you can learn to cope with that feeling before the avalanche of secondary emotions overwhelms you. This is where emotion regulation skills can be helpful. Emotion regulation skills are an important part of dialectical behavior therapy because they will help you cope with your distressing primary and secondary feelings in new and healthier ways (Dodge, 1989; Linehan, 1993a)."}, {"text": " These skills are especially useful, because without them, people often choose to deal with their primary and secondary emotions in ways that only cause them more suffering. In Shauna\u2019s example, it\u2019s easy to imagine that she could have chosen to use alcohol or drugs to deal with her feelings of anxiety, cutting or self-mutilation to deal with her feelings of depression, and binge eating to deal with her feelings of guilt."}, {"text": " These are all harmful coping strategies that are often used by people with overwhelming emotions. For this reason, it\u2019s extremely important that you learn the emotion regulation skills in this workbook so that you can cope with your primary and secondary emotions in healthier ways and avoid the prolonged suffering that often accompanies them."}, {"text": " Emotion regulation skills are also important for dealing with another problem called ambivalence. Ambivalence occurs when you have more than one emotional reaction to the same event and each emotion pulls you in a different direction or makes you want to do something different. For example, Tina had grown up without her father in her life."}, {"text": " Then one day when she was twenty-five, her father contacted her and wanted to see her. Tina felt excited about the opportunity of forming a new relationship with him, but she was equally angry with him for abandoning her family. Clearly Tina\u2019s emotions were split, and they pulled her in two different directions about what to do."}, {"text": " If you\u2019ve been dealing with overwhelming emotions for a long time, it\u2019s easy to understand that you might feel frustrated and hopeless about controlling your emotional reactions. But remember: although it might be difficult to control your primary emotional reaction, there\u2019s still hope that you can learn to control your secondary emotional responses as well as how you choose to cope with your emotions."}, {"text": " And it could be that later on, when you start using all the skills in this workbook, especially the mindfulness skills, you might even gain some control over your primary emotional responses too.  HOW DO EMOTIONS WORK? Emotions are electrical and chemical signals in your body that alert you to what is happening."}, {"text": " These signals often begin with your senses of sight, touch, hearing, smell, and taste. Then the signals travel to your brain, where they are processed in an area called the limbic system, which specializes in observing and processing emotions so that you can respond to emotional situations. The limbic system is also connected to the rest of your brain and body so that it can tell your body what to do in response to an emotional situation."}, {"text": " Your emotions are extremely important for many reasons, especially your survival. Here\u2019s an example. Louise was walking down Main Street when suddenly a very large and angry dog began  122\u2003\u2003The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook  \fbarking viciously and running toward her. In that instant, an emotional signal was sent from her eyes and ears to her brain."}, {"text": " Her limbic system then processed the information without Louise having to think about what to do. This type of response is called fight or flight, and it determined if Louise was going to stay to fight the dog or run away. Wisely, she chose to run away, and she escaped without being harmed. Her emotions helped her survive and avoid any pain."}, {"text": " Now let\u2019s suppose that two weeks later she was once again walking through town when she started to turn down Main Street. Very quickly, she began to feel afraid. This is called a conditioned response. Louise\u2019s limbic system was trying to protect her by helping her remember the dangerous dog on Main Street."}, {"text": " Sensibly, she chose to walk down a different street to avoid the dog. In this example, Louise\u2019s emotions initially helped her escape danger and pain, and later, they also helped her avoid potential harm. Here\u2019s another example of how emotions work. Sheila was walking through town when she suddenly saw Courtney, a good friend from many years before."}, {"text": " Immediately, Sheila felt happy. When Courtney saw Sheila, she smiled right away. Sheila noticed her smile and thought, \u201cShe must be happy to see me too.\u201d So Sheila smiled as well. The two women quickly reconnected and made plans to do something together in the near future. The encounter made both women feel happy that they\u2019d met accidentally after so many years."}, {"text": " In this example, the smile was an act of communication for both women. It helped each person recognize how the other person was feeling. If Courtney had frowned and looked the other way when she saw Sheila, Sheila would have recognized the expression as one of disgust and would probably have avoided contact with her."}, {"text": " Every person, no matter what their culture, has the ability to express emotions in the same way and to recognize emotional expressions in other people. A smile is a smile no matter where you were born. These are just two very simple examples, but you can see that emotions serve many purposes. Emotions are signals that help you to do the following: \u000e\u000e  Survive (\u201cfight or flight\u201d)."}, {"text": "  \u000e\u000e  Remember people and situations.  \u000e\u000e  Cope with situations in your daily life.  \u000e\u000e  Communicate with others.  \u000e\u000e  Avoid pain.  \u000e\u000e  Seek pleasure.  WHAT ARE EMOTION REGULATION SKILLS?

For example, Jim lost his favorite watch (a behavior)."}, {"text": " He felt sad (an emotion), and then he thought to himself, \u201cI\u2019m so absentminded; I\u2019m an idiot\u201d (a thought).

Do you see how your emotions can be both the result and the cause of your thoughts and behaviors? This can become a vicious cycle for your emotions if you get caught in self-destructive behaviors or self-critical thinking."}, {"text": " But this cycle can also lead to more fulfilling emotional experiences if you engage in healthy behaviors and self-affirming thoughts. For example, maybe after Jim lost his watch (a behavior) and felt sad (an emotion), he could have used a coping thought like \u201cMistakes happen; nobody\u2019s perfect.\u201d Then he might have been able to forgive himself for his mistake (another thought) and continue his day, feeling at ease (an emotion)."}, {"text": " Or after feeling sad about losing his watch, maybe he could have gone for a long walk (a behavior), which would have made him feel refreshed (an emotion). There were many coping thoughts and behaviors Jim could have used to prevent getting caught in a cycle of distressing emotions.  EMOTIONS AND YOUR BEHAVIORS Clearly, your emotions and your behaviors are strongly linked, and, not surprisingly, stronger emotions often lead to bigger behavioral reactions."}, {"text": " As a result, many people with overwhelming feelings also struggle with out-of-control behaviors. People with overwhelming emotions often do many selfdestructive things when they feel angry, depressed, or anxious. They cut or mutilate themselves, manipulate others (which often leads to fights and destructive relationships), overeat, undereat, drink alcohol excessively, and use street drugs."}, {"text": " Obviously, these types of behaviors are harmful to everyone who\u2019s involved. Yet people who engage in these behaviors often do them repeatedly. So the question remains: why do people do these types of things? The answer lies in your emotions. Let\u2019s start with the basics: many behaviors are repeated because they are rewarded."}, {"text": " A person goes to work for the reward of a paycheck. A student goes to school for the reward of a degree. People play sports for the reward of competing. A musician plays an instrument for the reward of  132\u2003\u2003The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook  \fcreating music. And a gardener plants flowers for the reward of seeing them blossom."}, {"text": " All of these rewards reinforce these behaviors and make them more likely to be repeated in the future. If you didn\u2019t get a paycheck for going to work, you wouldn\u2019t go anymore. If your teachers told you that there was no chance for you to graduate, you\u2019d probably drop out. And if you only got weeds every time you planted a garden, you\u2019d probably stop doing that too."}, {"text": " In the same way, your emotions can serve as rewards that reinforce your behavior. Here\u2019s a simple example of how pleasurable emotions can reinforce a behavior: Phil helped his friend Stefan move into a new apartment (a behavior). Stefan was very grateful, which made Phil feel happy about helping him (an emotion)."}, {"text": " So the next time Stefan asked for a favor, Phil was happy to help him again (another behavior) because it would make him feel good again (another emotion). However, emotions can reinforce self-destructive behaviors as well. Consider this example: Teresa, who struggled with overwhelming emotions, once said, \u201cIf I feel bad, I want my husband to feel bad too."}, {"text": "\u201d Logically, this doesn\u2019t make sense, but thoughts, emotions, and behaviors aren\u2019t always logical.

No one paid attention to how she felt."}, {"text": " Then, as an adult, she realized that someone would give her and her pain attention if she hurt the other person too, usually by making them feel upset. For example, when Teresa felt upset at work, she would go home and pick a fight with her husband about something unimportant (her behavior), and he would feel miserable as well."}, {"text": " Then he would finally recognize how Teresa felt and talk to her about her feelings (which was her emotional reward). Teresa may not have been consciously aware that she was hurting her husband on purpose, but that didn\u2019t matter.

Teresa and her husband had frequent fights as a result of her behaviors, and these fights always made her feel even worse.  Basic Emotion Regulation Skills\u2003\u2003 133  \fThe emotional rewards that reinforce self-destructive behaviors are important to understand."}, {"text": " Two types of self-destructive behaviors that people with overwhelming emotions often engage in are cutting/self-mutilation and manipulating others. Both of these behaviors offer short-term rewards that make them likely to be repeated, but both types of behaviors are also followed by long-term damage."}, {"text": " (In the next section, Reducing Your Physical Vulnerability to Overwhelming Emotions, you\u2019ll learn about self-destructive eating and substance-use behaviors too.)  Cutting/Self-Mutilation Many people who cut, burn, or scar themselves say that their actions make them feel better or that their actions relieve some of their pain."}, {"text": " To a certain degree, they\u2019re right. Cutting and other types of self-mutilation can cause the body to release natural painkillers called endorphins that help heal the wound. These painkillers can make a person feel physically and emotionally better for a very short amount of time. Yet as temporary as these rewards are, these physical and emotional feelings reinforce self-mutilation in the future."}, {"text": " But remember, these behaviors can be dangerous and possibly lead to death or infection. And while the pain relief is temporary, the scars, the memories, and the guilt that often accompany these actions still remain. If you engage in any cutting or self-mutilating behaviors, identify what those behaviors are in the space below."}, {"text": " Then identify what the temporary rewards might be. And finally, identify what the long-term cost and dangers are, due to those behaviors.

Her behavior was rewarded with emotional validation, so it was repeated in the future. But, the frequent fights with her husband made her feel even worse in the long run."}, {"text": " Similarly, other forms of manipulation can have short-lived emotional rewards that lead to repetition. When you force someone into doing what you want, maybe you feel satisfied or in control. These can all be strong emotional rewards, especially considering that many people with overwhelming emotions feel like their own lives are out of control."}, {"text": " But, again, even these emotional rewards are temporary. Here are some examples. Whenever Brandy felt bored she liked to \u201cmess with people,\u201d just to give herself pleasure. Often she would lie to her friends and tell them phony rumors she claimed to have heard about them. Then, when her friends would get upset, Brandy would pretend to comfort them."}, {"text": " This made her feel powerful, until her friends discovered the truth and then stopped talking to her. Similarly, Jason was very controlling of his girlfriend Patricia. When they would go out for dinner, he would order for her, even if she wanted something different.

Eventually, the person who is being manipulated gets tired of being controlled and puts up resistance."}, {"text": " Then the relationship becomes confrontational and unrewarding and often ends very painfully. This is usually the worst possible result for a person struggling with overwhelming emotions because he or she is often extremely afraid of being abandoned by others. In fact, all the manipulative behaviors are usually attempts to cope with this fear of being left alone and to force people to stay with them."}, {"text": " But when the relationships fail, the fear of being abandoned becomes a reality, and this can set off even more incidents of self-destructive behaviors.

Food Your body needs the nutrients it gets from food in order to keep functioning properly, just as a car depends on gasoline to keep running. As a result, the food you eat affects how you feel directly, both emotionally and physically.

Over time, if you eat an excessive amount of food with high levels of fat or sugar, you\u2019ll also gain weight."}, {"text": " This often makes people feel sad or unhappy about themselves, and it can also lead to health problems like diabetes and heart disease. Other foods with high sugar content, like candy and soda, can quickly make you feel energized. But as the effect wears off, these foods can leave you feeling very tired or even depressed."}, {"text": " Just as eating too much of certain foods can make you feel ill, eating too little food can also make you feel unhealthy.

And, again, these feelings lead to the person\u2019s behavior being repeated in the future. Equally dangerous is the fact that some people try to control their overeating by engaging in purging activities like vomiting."}, {"text": " Frequent purging can lead to a very dangerous eating disorder called bulimia that can have \u00addevastating effects on your body. Drastic undereating can also make a person feel good for a short amount of time. Undereating can serve as a form of self-control. Many times, people with overwhelming emotions feel like their lives are out of their own control, and undereating gives them a sense of power over their lives that makes them feel better."}, {"text": " However, this quest for control can be dangerous because excessive undereating can lead to anorexia, an extremely unhealthy and potentially life-threatening eating disorder characterized by a person\u2019s drastically reduced weight.

This type of thinking is called filtering (Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979). Here are some examples: \u000e\u000e  Zeva was a straight-A student, she always made the honor roll, and she had already received a full scholarship to her first choice of colleges."}, {"text": " But when she got a poor grade on her math test she broke down. \u201cI\u2019m such a loser,\u201d she thought to herself, and, very quickly, she felt overwhelmed, upset, and angry.  \u000e\u000e  Antonio asked his girlfriend if she could come over at three o\u2019clock. She said that she was busy until seven, and she\u2019d come over then."}, {"text": " Antonio immediately got angry and accused her of abandoning him.  \u000e\u000e  Jennifer grew up in a typical middle-class family in a fairly good neighborhood. Most often, her parents were kind and supportive, and they always tried to do their best for her. However, one day when Jennifer was five, her father punished her for talking back to him, and she was grounded for a week."}, {"text": " Later, as an adult, whenever Jennifer thought about her young life, she only remembered that incident, and she got upset whenever she thought about it.  Do you see the filtering in each person\u2019s thought process? Zeva was devastated by one less-thanperfect grade because she filtered out all of her past successes."}, {"text": " Antonio filtered out the fact that his girlfriend said she would come over at a different, more convenient time. And Jennifer filtered out all of her positive childhood experiences and only focused on the one hardship she\u2019d experienced. Imagine living your life with dark sunglasses on all the time so that it\u2019s impossible to see the colors of the world."}, {"text": " Think about what a limited, dreary life you might have. Similarly, when you filter your experience and only focus on the distressing elements of your life, you\u2019re also choosing to live a limited, unfulfilling life. In order to begin balancing your thoughts\u2014and therefore your emotions as well\u2014it\u2019s \u00adnecessary to examine the evidence that supports both sides of an emotion-stimulating event: \u000e\u000e  Evidence supporting your self-criticisms versus evidence that you\u2019re a good person  \u000e\u000e  Evidence that only bad things happen to you versus evidence that good things happen too  \u000e\u000e  Evidence that no one cares about you versus evidence that people do care about you  \u000e\u000e  Evidence that you never do anything right versus evidence of your past successes  \u000e\u000e  Evidence that the current situation is awful versus evidence that it\u2019s not as bad as you think  Basic Emotion Regulation Skills\u2003\u2003 151  \f\u000e\u000e  In general, evidence for the bad versus evidence for the good  Seeing the \u201cbig picture\u201d is the opposite of filtering."}, {"text": " This can be hard to do if you\u2019ve spent your life narrowly focusing on just the negative evidence in your life. But you can learn to see the big picture by examining the evidence that goes against your distressing thoughts and feelings. These facts, which are often ignored by people with overwhelming emotions, fill out the rest of the big picture and can often change how you feel about a situation."}, {"text": " Then, with practice, you\u2019ll filter less of your experiences and become less overwhelmed by your emotions. In order to see the big picture, use the following guidelines. Whenever you find yourself in a situation in which you feel overwhelmed by your emotions, ask yourself these questions: 1.\t  What happened?  2."}, {"text": "\t  As a result, what did you think and feel? (Be specific.)  3.\t  What evidence supports how you think and feel?  4.\t  What evidence contradicts how you think and feel?  5.\t  What\u2019s a more accurate and fair way to think and feel about this situation?  6.\t  What can you do to cope with this situation in a healthy way?  Naturally, when you start to feel overwhelmed by a situation, first ask yourself what happened."}, {"text": " This is the best place to start. Identify what it is that\u2019s making you feel upset. Using Zeva as an example, she would have noted that she got a poor grade on her math test. Second, identify your thoughts and feelings. Remember, your thoughts greatly influence how you feel. But if your thoughts about a situation are being filtered and you\u2019re not seeing the big picture, your thoughts are more likely to cause overwhelming, distressing emotions."}, {"text": " In Zeva\u2019s example, she thought, \u201cI\u2019m such a loser,\u201d and then she felt overwhelmed, upset, and angry. Third, ask yourself what evidence supports how you\u2019re thinking and feeling about the situation. This is usually an easy question to answer. If you\u2019ve spent your life filtering your experiences so that you only see the negative, distressing facts, it\u2019s easy to think of lots of reasons why you feel so distressed and overwhelmed."}, {"text": " After all, this is what you usually do. Zeva could easily identify why she was feeling so upset: she had studied hard, as she always did, but had gotten a poor grade on her test, which was her lowest score all year. The fourth question, however, is usually new and challenging for people struggling with overwhelming emotions."}, {"text": " Asking yourself to identify the evidence that contradicts how you think and feel about a situation requires that you view the situation in a new and deeper way. For instance, imagine how much different the world must look to a person standing on the street when compared to a person flying above in an airplane."}, {"text": " They\u2019re both looking at the same landscape, but the person in the plane has a better view of the whole landscape\u2014the big picture. Similarly, you need to examine more of the facts and evidence that affect your situation and make up your big picture. As you saw earlier in the examples, people often filter out the positive elements of their lives and ignore the facts that might change the way they feel about a situation."}, {"text": " If you really want to stop being overwhelmed by your emotions, you\u2019ll have to look at all those facts.  152\u2003\u2003The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook  \fRemember what Zeva filtered out? She\u2019s a straight-A student, she\u2019s on the honor roll, and she got a full scholarship to her first choice of colleges."}, {"text": " Now consider how that information contradicts what she thought (\u201cI\u2019m a loser\u201d) and how she felt (overwhelmed, upset, and angry). Obviously, Zeva filtered out some very important pieces of her big picture. Remember, since this question is new for you, it often takes some time to think of an answer."}, {"text": " So give yourself a few minutes to think about the possible facts before saying, \u201cThere is no contradictory evidence.\u201d Be fair and kind to yourself. There\u2019s always evidence for and against any topic. And even if the contradictory evidence is minor, it still adds to your big picture. Consider Zeva\u2019s example."}, {"text": " Even if her example was different and she was a B student or a hardworking student, these facts still could have changed the way she felt about the poor grade. No fact or contradictory piece of evidence is too small to be overlooked. Next, keeping in mind the new evidence that contradicts the trigger thought, ask yourself if there is a more accurate and fair way to think and feel about this situation."}, {"text": " This is a good time to be mindful of your emotions and to use radical acceptance. Remember, this exercise is designed to help you look at your emotional reactions in a new way; it is not designed to criticize you. Therefore, don\u2019t be critical of yourself. Try to be accepting of yourself and your emotions as you continue to see your emotions in a new way."}, {"text": " In this step, add the new evidence to your big picture and try to create a more accurate and fair way to think and feel about this situation. In reality, this might not change how you feel right now, but it will help you to notice how you could feel about this situation in the future. Using these skills, Zeva\u2019s answer could have been something like, \u201cIt\u2019s okay to feel disappointed because I studied a lot and I didn\u2019t do well."}, {"text": " But this is just one bad grade. I mostly get A\u2019s, and I\u2019m doing well in general.\u201d Finally, Zeva would have asked, \u201cWhat can I do to cope with this situation in a healthy way?\u201d Here is where you should draw from all the skills and techniques you\u2019ve learned in this workbook to help you distract, relax, and cope."}, {"text": " For example, Zeva could have used some of the distress tolerance and self-soothing skills to calm her emotions, like talking to a friend or listening to some relaxing music. She could also have used her mindfulness skills, like mindful breathing or thought defusion. Or she could have used a coping thought, like \u201cNobody\u2019s perfect; everyone makes mistakes."}, {"text": "\u201d Obviously, using the questions in this exercise isn\u2019t going to magically change the way you feel right away. But asking yourself these questions will help you recognize the facts that you\u2019ve been filtering out, and it will also show you the possibilities of how you might react to a similar situation in the future."}, {"text": " Then, with practice, you\u2019ll start reacting to those similar situations in a new, healthier way. Seeing the big picture will also give you hope for your future. Many people who filter their experiences feel hopeless and desperate because they\u2019re only seeing the problems and the difficulties in their lives."}, {"text": " But looking for contrary evidence opens up their perspectives and lets them see that their lives do include some positive experiences. Looking for evidence against overwhelming emotions is like taking off those dark sunglasses so that you can see the variety of colors in your life, and that\u2019s a hopeful experience."}, {"text": " Use the following evidence log to help you recognize the evidence for and against the ways you think and feel. Make photocopies of the log and keep one with you. Then, when you\u2019re in a situation in which you feel overwhelmed, use the log to help you see the big picture. Use the \u00adfollowing example of Zeva\u2019s experience to help you."}, {"text": "  Basic Emotion Regulation Skills\u2003\u2003 153  \f154\u2003\u2003The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook Your Responses I got a poor grade on my math test.

Now, however, you understand that many people with overwhelming emotions discount their pleasurable emotions, filter them out, or never take the opportunity to experience them in the first place."}, {"text": " As a result, they focus only on their distressing emotions, such as anger, fear, and sadness, and they rarely notice their pleasurable emotions, such as happiness, surprise, and love.

This doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019ll never experience another distressing feeling. That\u2019s impossible."}, {"text": " We all have distressing emotions at different points in our lives. But your life doesn\u2019t have to be dominated by them. One very reliable way of focusing on pleasurable emotions is to create pleasurable experiences for yourself.

Now, in this chapter, emotion exposure will further help you practice two very important things."}, {"text": " First, you will learn to observe the natural life cycle of your emotions, watching them rise and fall, shift and change as new emotions replace old ones. Second, you\u2019ll learn that you can endure\u2014without avoidance or resistance\u2014your strong feelings. You\u2019ll get practice staying \u201cin\u201d the emotion even though you want to run or turn the feeling into action (shouting, hitting, or breaking things)."}, {"text": " Emotion exposure is a crucial process for learning not to fear your feelings. And it will strengthen your emotion regulation skills. The more you practice this exposure work, the more confident you\u2019ll become as you face tough emotional challenges. In addition to being mindful of your emotions without judgment and emotion exposure, you\u2019ll learn a behavioral technique called doing the opposite of your emotional urges."}, {"text": " When you have a strong emotion, it affects behavior in two ways. First, you change your facial expression and body language to reflect your feeling. If you\u2019re angry, you may begin to scowl and tighten your fists. On the other hand, if you\u2019re scared, your eyes may open wide while you hunch your shoulders."}, {"text": " The second behavioral change comes from action urges that accompany every emotion. Anger, for example, may produce urges to shout or hit, while fear might push you to cower or back away.  \f\u201cDoing the opposite of your emotional urges\u201d is a strategy that blocks ineffective, emotion-driven responses while often helping you to soften the feeling itself."}, {"text": " The next step will be learning key behavior analysis and problem-solving skills to deal more effectively with high-emotion situations. You\u2019ll identify what prompts the emotion and learn how to develop alternative strategies to cope with emotion-triggering events. The last thing we\u2019ll do in this chapter is introduce you to an exercise regime called the Weekly Regulator."}, {"text": " It will help you to keep practicing the key emotion regulation skills you\u2019ve learned here. Learning to be mindful of your emotions with9out judging them decreases the chance that they will grow in intensity and become even more painful.  BEING MINDFUL OF YOUR EMOTIONS WITHOUT JUDGMENT Learning to be mindful of your emotions without judging them decreases the chance that they will grow in intensity and become even more overwhelming or painful."}, {"text": "  Exercise: Being Mindful of Your Emotions Without Judgment This technique begins with the mindful awareness of your breath. Focus on the feeling of the air moving across your throat, how your ribs expand and contract, and the sense of your diaphragm stretching and releasing. After four or five slow, deep breaths, you can do one of two things: (1) observe whatever current emotion you may be feeling, or if you can\u2019t identify an emotion, (2) visualize a recent scene where you experienced an emotional reaction."}, {"text": " If you visualize a scene, notice as many details as possible. Try to remember what was said and how you and others acted. Read the instructions before beginning the exercise to familiarize yourself with the experience. If you feel more comfortable listening to the instructions, use an audio-recording device to record the directions in a slow, even voice, so that you can listen to them while practicing this technique."}, {"text": "  Instructions While breathing slowly and evenly, bring your attention to where you are feeling the emotion in your body. Is it a feeling in your chest or stomach, in your shoulders, or in your face or head? Are you feeling it in your arms or legs? Notice any physical sensations connected with the emotion."}, {"text": " Now be aware of the strength of the feeling. Is it growing or diminishing? Is the emotion pleasant or painful? Try to name the emotion or describe some of its qualities.  160\u2003\u2003The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook  \fNow try to notice your thoughts. Do you have thoughts about the emotion? Does the emotion trigger judgments about others or about yourself? Just keep watching your emotion and keep observing your judgments."}, {"text": " Now imagine that each judgment is one of the following: \u000e\u000e  A leaf floating down a stream, around a bend, and out of sight  \u000e\u000e  A computer pop-up ad that briefly flashes on the screen and disappears  \u000e\u000e  One of a long string of boxcars passing in front of you at a railroad crossing  \u000e\u000e  A cloud cutting across a windy sky  \u000e\u000e  A message written on a billboard that you approach and pass at high speed  \u000e\u000e  One of a procession of trucks or cars approaching and passing you on a desert highway  Choose the image that works best for you."}, {"text": " The key is to notice the judgment, place it on a billboard or leaf or boxcar, and let it go. Just keep observing your emotion. When a judgment about yourself or others begins to manifest, turn it into a visualization (leaf, cloud, billboard, and so on) and watch while it moves away and out of sight."}, {"text": " Now it\u2019s time to remind yourself of the right to feel whatever you feel. Emotions come and go, like waves on the sea. They rise up and then recede. Whatever you feel, no matter how strong or painful, is legitimate and necessary. Take a slow breath and accept the emotion as something that lives in you for a little while\u2014and then passes."}, {"text": " Notice your judgmental thoughts. Visualize them and then let them pass. Let your emotions be what they are, like waves on the sea that rise and fall. You ride your emotions for a little while, and then they leave. This is natural and normal. It\u2019s what it means to be human. Finish the exercise with three minutes of mindful breathing, counting your out-breaths (1, 2, 3, 4 and then repeating 1, 2, 3, 4) and focusing on the experience of each moment as you breathe."}, {"text": " Looking back on this exercise, you may have found it to be hard work. Watching and letting go of judgments may feel very foreign, very strange. But you are doing something important\u2014you are learning to observe rather than be controlled by judgmental thoughts. We encourage you to do this exercise three or four times before going on to the next step."}, {"text": " Remember, the key steps to the practice of observing your emotions without judging them are as follows: \u000e\u000e  Focus on breath.  \u000e\u000e  Focus on emotion (current or past).  \u000e\u000e  Notice physical sensations connected to emotion.  \u000e\u000e  Name the emotion.  Advanced Emotion Regulation Skills\u2003\u2003 161  \f\u000e\u000e  Notice judgments (about self, others, or the emotion itself) and let them go."}, {"text": " Use \u201cleaves on a stream\u201d or other image.  \u000e\u000e  Watch the emotion; emotions are like waves on the sea.  \u000e\u000e  Remind yourself that you have a right to your feelings.  \u000e\u000e  Continue to notice and let go of judgments.  \u000e\u000e  Finish with three minutes of mindful breathing.  EMOTION EXPOSURE Facing your emotions instead of avoiding them is a major goal of dialectical behavior therapy."}, {"text": " Emotion exposure helps you develop the capacity to accept feelings and be less afraid of them. Step 1 is to begin keeping an Emotion Log so you can become more aware of specific emotional events and how you cope with them. For the next week, keep a record in your Emotion Log for every significant emotion you experience."}, {"text": " Under \u201cEvent,\u201d write down what precipitated your feeling. Triggering events could be internal\u2014a thought, memory, or another feeling\u2014or they could be external, something you or someone else said or did. Under \u201cEmotion,\u201d write a word or phrase that sums up your feeling. Under \u201cCoping or Blocking Response,\u201d write what you did to try to push the emotion away."}, {"text": " Did you try to suppress or hide it? Did you act on it by picking a fight or avoiding something scary? This record of your coping or blocking response will help you identify emotions for doing emotion exposure later in this chapter.

Chapters 6 and 7 on emotion regulation will give you words for the nuances  \fof what you feel and techniques to classify the emotion. For our purposes here, you can identify emotions through a simple decision-making process called a decision tree.

If the feeling is good, is it more like satisfaction, excitement, sexual attraction, love/affection, contentment, joy, pleasant anticipation, interest, or satiety? If the feeling is bad, is it more like anxiety, fear, anger, resentment, sadness, grief/loss, hurt, anger or disgust with oneself, embarrassment/shame, guilt, yearning/deprivation, or loneliness/emptiness? The decision tree looks like this:  EMOTIONS Good\tBad Satisfaction\t  Anxiety (for the future)  Excitement\t  Fear (of something now)  Sexual attraction\t  Anger  Love/affection\tResentment Contentment\tSadness Joy\tGrief/loss Pleasant anticipation \t  Hurt  Interest \t  Anger or disgust with oneself  Satiety \t  Embarrassment/shame  \tGuilt \tYearning/deprivation \tLoneliness/emptiness Allan, for example, was aware that something felt wrong in his relationship with his father."}, {"text": " When he looked at the list of feelings, the one that seemed closest was hurt\u2014with a little bit of resentment.

Let\u2019s face it, fear sells. Unfortunately, as stressful and anxiety-arousing as the world is today, only a minority of those suffering from anxiety seek treatment. That\u2019s a problem, because anxiety causes not only emotional pain and distress but also physical strain and even death, given that anxiety extracts a serious toll on the body and sometimes even contributes to suicide."}, {"text": " Furthermore, anxiety costs society as a whole, to the tune of billions of dollars. When people talk about what anxiety feels like, you may hear any or all of the following descriptions: \u2713 When my panic attacks begin, I feel tightness in my chest.

One investigation at Duke University divided cardiac patients into three groups: an exercise group, a stress management group, and a care-as-usual group."}, {"text": " After five years, the stress management group had fewer additional heart-related problems than the other two groups. Although this  was a small study, one researcher concluded that managing stress and anxiety is one of the most powerful tools in fighting heart disease. The other study, published in the January 2002 issue of the journal Stroke, found that men who suffer from anxiety and depression are much more likely to die from strokes than those without these psychological problems."}, {"text": "  What does anxiety cost you? Obviously, if you have a problem with anxiety, you experience the cost of distressed, anxious feelings. Anxiety feels lousy. You don\u2019t need to read a book to know that. But did you know that untreated anxiety runs up a tab in other ways as well? These costs include \u2713 A physical toll: Higher blood pressure, tension headaches, and gastrointestinal symptoms can affect your body."}, {"text": " In fact, recent research found that certain types of chronic anxiety disorders change the makeup of your brain\u2019s structures. \u2713 A toll on your kids: Parents with anxiety more often have anxious children. This is due in part to genetics, but it\u2019s also because kids learn from observation. Anxious kids may be so stressed that they can\u2019t pay attention in school."}, {"text": " \u2713 Fat!: Anxiety and stress increase the stress hormone known as cortisol. Cortisol causes fat storage in the abdominal area, thus increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke. Stress also leads to increased eating. \u2713 More trips to the doctor: That\u2019s because those with anxiety frequently experience worrisome physical symptoms."}, {"text": " In addition, anxious people often worry a great deal about their health. \u2713 Relationship problems: People with anxiety frequently feel irritable. Sometimes, they withdraw emotionally or do the opposite and dependently cling to their partners. \u2713 Downtime: Those with anxiety disorders miss work more often than other people, usually as an effort to temporarily quell their distress."}, {"text": "  05_574416-ch01.indd 11  3/22/10 9:47 PM  \f12  Part I: Detecting and Exposing Anxiety  Adding up the cost to society Anxiety costs many billions of dollars worldwide. A U.S. government report says that anxiety costs more than depression, schizophrenia, or any other emotional problem. The annual tab is estimated at more than $65 billion."}, {"text": " The United Kingdom spent 32 billion pounds (approximately $53 billion) on mental healthcare in 2002, a huge portion of which was spent on anxietyrelated problems. Even countries that spend little on mental healthcare incur substantial costs from anxiety disorders. These costs include \u2713 Decreased productivity \u2713 Healthcare costs \u2713 Medications Decreased productivity is sometimes due to health problems made worse by anxiety."}, {"text": " But the financial loss from downtime and healthcare costs doesn\u2019t include the dollars lost to substance abuse, which many of those with anxiety disorders turn to in order to deal with their anxiety. Thus, directly and indirectly, anxiety extracts a colossal toll on both the person who experiences it and society at large."}, {"text": "  Recognizing the Symptoms of Anxiety You may not know if you suffer from anxiety or an anxiety disorder. That\u2019s because anxiety involves a wide range of symptoms. Each person experiences a slightly different constellation of these symptoms. And your specific constellation determines what kind of anxiety disorder you may have."}, {"text": " We discuss the various types of anxiety disorders in detail in Chapter 2. For now, you should know that some signs of anxiety appear in the form of thoughts or beliefs. Other indications of anxiety manifest themselves in bodily sensations. Still other symptoms show up in various kinds of anxious behaviors."}, {"text": " Some people experience anxiety signs in all three ways, while others only perceive their anxiety in one or two areas.  Thinking anxiously Folks with anxiety generally think in ways that differ from the ways that other people think.

Behaving anxiously We have three words to describe anxious behavior \u2014 avoidance, avoidance, and avoidance. Anxious people inevitably attempt to stay away from the things that make them anxious."}, {"text": " Whether it\u2019s snakes, heights, crowds, freeways, parties, paying bills, reminders of bad times, or public speaking, anxious people search for ways out. In the short run, avoidance lowers anxiety. It makes you feel a little better. However, in the long run, avoidance actually maintains and heightens anxiety."}, {"text": " We give you ways of dismantling avoidance in Chapter 8. One of the most common and obvious examples of anxiety-induced avoidance is how people react to their phobias. Have you ever seen the response of a spider phobic when confronting one of the critters? Usually, such folks hastily retreat.  Finding anxiety in your body Almost all people with severe anxiety experience a range of physical effects."}, {"text": " These sensations don\u2019t simply occur in your head; they\u2019re as real as this book you\u2019re holding.

Or they believe that the only effective treatment out there is medication, and they hate the possibility of side effects. Others fret about the costs of getting help. And still others have concerns that tackling their anxiety would cause their fears to increase so much that they wouldn\u2019t be able to stand it."}, {"text": " Well, stop adding worry to worry. You can significantly reduce your anxiety through a variety of interesting strategies. Many of these don\u2019t have to cost a single cent. And if one doesn\u2019t work, you can try another. Most people find that at least a couple of the approaches that we review work for them."}, {"text": " The following sections provide an overview of treatment options and give you some guidance on what to do if your self-help efforts fall short. Untreated anxiety may cause long-term health problems. It doesn\u2019t make sense to avoid doing something about your anxiety.  Matching symptoms and therapies Anxiety symptoms appear in three different spheres, as follows (see the earlier section \u201cRecognizing the Symptoms of Anxiety\u201d for more details on these symptoms): \u2713 Thinking symptoms: The thoughts that run through your mind \u2713 Behaving symptoms: The things you do in response to anxiety \u2713 Feeling symptoms: How your body reacts to anxiety Treatment corresponds to each of these three areas, as we discuss in the following three sections."}, {"text": "  Thinking therapies One of the most effective treatments for a wide range of emotional problems, known as cognitive therapy, deals with the way you think about, perceive, and interpret everything that\u2019s important to you, including \u2713 Your views about yourself \u2713 The events that happen to you in life \u2713 Your future  05_574416-ch01."}, {"text": "indd 15  3/22/10 9:47 PM  \f16  Part I: Detecting and Exposing Anxiety  Ten dubious duds This book is designed to give you ideas on how to beat anxiety. Beware the following things, which make anxiety worse:  \u2713 Drinking or illegal drugs: Substances may relieve anxiety for a short while, but they actually increase anxiety in the long run."}, {"text": "  \u2713 Avoidance: Avoiding what scares you makes anxiety worse. For example, if you\u2019re afraid of driving on a freeway and only use side streets, your fear of driving on crowded, fast roads will get worse.  \u2713 Trying too hard: If you push yourself too hard and feel anxious about your progress, you\u2019re just going to make things worse."}, {"text": " Slow down a little.  \u2713 Whining and complaining: People love to do this, but it only makes things worse. \u2713 Seeking reassurance: When people give you reassurance, it feels good. But the effects are short-lived, and reassurance can actually make anxiety worse. \u2713 Seeking quick fixes: The Internet is full of quick fixes, but we don\u2019t know of any that have really been proven to work."}, {"text": " \u2713 Psychoanalysis: This approach to therapy works for some problems, but it hasn\u2019t collected much support in alleviating anxiety.  \u2713 Sipping herbal drinks: There\u2019s nothing wrong with using these as a short-term crutch, but don\u2019t count on them to cure your problem. \u2713 Hoping for miracles: Hope is good \u2014 miracles do happen \u2014 but it\u2019s not a good idea to sit around and wait for one to come along."}, {"text": " \u2713 Taking medication as a sole solution: Some medications help some people with some anxiety problems, some of the time. But the strategies and therapies described in this book have proven to be more reliable and effective in the long run.  When people feel unusually anxious and worried, they almost inevitably distort the way they think about these things."}, {"text": " That distortion actually causes much of their anxiety. In the following example, Luann has both physical symptoms and cognitive symptoms of anxiety. Her therapist chooses a cognitive approach to help her. Luann, a junior in college, gets physically ill before every exam. She throws up, has diarrhea, and her heart races."}, {"text": " She fantasizes that she will fail each and every test she takes and that eventually, the college will dismiss her. Yet, her lowest grade to date has been a B\u2013. The cognitive approach her therapist uses helps her capture the negative predictions and catastrophic outcomes that run through her mind."}, {"text": " It then guides her to search for evidence about her true performance and a more realistic appraisal of the chances of her actually failing. As simple as this approach sounds, hundreds of studies have found that it works well to reduce anxiety.

You can get good ideas on those actions in Chapter 10. On the other hand, one type of action that targets anxiety and can feel a little scary is exposure \u2014 breaking your fears down into small steps and facing them one at a time."}, {"text": " We cover exposure in Chapter 8. Some people, with the advice of their doctor, choose to take medications for their anxiety. If you\u2019re considering that option, be sure to see Chapter 9 to help you make an informed decision.  Feeling therapies \u2014 soothing the inner storm Anxiety sets off a storm of distressing physical symptoms, such as a racing heartbeat, upset stomach, muscle tension, sweating, dizziness, and so on."}, {"text": " We have a variety of suggestions, including breathing and relaxation techniques, for helping quell this turmoil. You may choose to make changes in your lifestyle (see Chapter 10), give the relaxation strategies we cover in Chapters 11 and 12 a try, or employ mindfulness, an approach that teaches you to connect with present moment experiences (see Chapter 13)."}, {"text": "  Choosing where to start We organize this book so you can start anywhere you want, but you may wonder whether one set of strategies would work better for you than another.

In the following anxiety quiz, check all the items that apply to you. If you check off more items in one category than the others, you may consider starting with the part of this book that applies to it. For example, Chapters 5, 6, and 7 are designed especially for thinkers and present the thinking therapies, also known as cognitive therapy; Chapter 8 is aimed at doers and provides the essentials of behavior therapy."}, {"text": " Part III focuses on feelers who may profit most by starting with strategies for quelling troubling bodily sensations and feelings through relaxation, diet, exercise, meditation, better sleep habits, and mindfulness.

And you\u2019d probably like to tackle anxiety on your own. This is a self-help book, after all. The good news is that self-help does work. A number of studies support the idea that people can deal with important, difficult problems without seeking the services of a professional."}, {"text": " People clearly benefit from self-help. They get better and stay better.  05_574416-ch01.indd 18  3/22/10 9:47 PM  \fChapter 1: Analyzing and Attacking Anxiety  19  Then again, sometimes self-help efforts fall short. Chapter 23 provides ten critical signs that indicate a likely need for professional help."}, {"text": " See Chapter 4 for information about finding the right professional for you. If you do need professional consultation, many qualified therapists will work with you on the ideas contained in this book. That\u2019s because most mentalhealth professionals will appreciate the comprehensive nature of the material and the fact that most of the strategies are based on well-proven methods."}, {"text": " If research has yet to support the value of a particular approach, we take care to let you know that. We happen to think you\u2019re much better off sticking with strategies known to work and avoiding those that don\u2019t.

For example, if you\u2019re driving in a snowstorm and your car starts to spin out of control, feeling anxious makes sense. But sometimes anxiety signals something more serious. To get a feel for the difference between something as serious as an anxiety disorder and a normal reaction, read the following description and imagine ten minutes in the life of Tiffany."}, {"text": " Tiffany feels restless and shifts her weight from foot to foot. Walking forward a little, she notices a slight tightening in her chest. Her breathing quickens. She feels an odd mixture of excitement and mounting tension. She sits down and does her best to relax, but the anxiety continues to intensify."}, {"text": " Her body suddenly jerks forward; she grips the sides of her seat and clenches her teeth to choke back a scream. Her stomach feels like it might come up through her throat. She feels her heart race and her face flush. Tiffany\u2019s emotions run wild. Dizziness, fear, and a rushing sensation overtake her."}, {"text": " The feelings all come in waves \u2014 one after the other. You may wonder what\u2019s wrong with poor Tiffany. Maybe she has an anxiety disorder. Or possibly she\u2019s suffering a nervous breakdown. Perhaps she\u2019s going crazy. No, Tiffany actually wanted to feel scared and anxious!  06_574416-ch02.indd 21  3/22/10 9:48 PM  \f22  Part I: Detecting and Exposing Anxiety You see, she was at an amusement park."}, {"text": " She handed her ticket to the attendant and buckled herself into a roller coaster. After that, you probably understand the rest of her experience. Tiffany doesn\u2019t have an anxiety disorder, she isn\u2019t suffering a nervous breakdown, and she isn\u2019t going crazy. As her story illustrates, the symptoms of anxiety can be ordinary reactions to life."}, {"text": " In this chapter, we help you figure out whether you\u2019re suffering from an anxiety disorder, everyday anxiety, or something else.

Knowing When Anxiety Is a Help and When It\u2019s a Hindrance Imagine a life with no anxiety at all."}, {"text": " How wonderful! You awaken every morning anticipating nothing but pleasant experiences. You fear nothing. The future holds only sweet security and joy. Think again.

With no worries about the future, your retirement may end up bleak."}, {"text": " The total absence of anxiety may cause you to walk into a work presentation unprepared. Anxiety is good for you! It prepares you to take action. It mobilizes your body for emergencies. It warns you about danger. Be glad you have some anxiety. Your anxiety helps you stay out of trouble. Anxiety poses a problem for you when \u2713 It lasts uncomfortably long or occurs too often."}, {"text": " For example, if you have anxiety most days for more than a few weeks, you have reason for concern. \u2713 It interferes with doing what you want to do. Thus, if anxiety wakes you up at night, causes you to make mistakes at work, or keeps you from going where you want to go, it\u2019s getting in the way. \u2713 It exceeds the level of actual danger or risk."}, {"text": " For example, if your body and mind feel like an avalanche is about to bury you but all you\u2019re doing is taking a test for school, your anxiety has gone too far. \u2713 You struggle to control your worries, but they keep on coming.

The word \u201canxious\u201d is a derivative of the Latin word angere, meaning to strangle or choke. A sense of choking or tightening in the throat or chest is a common symptom of anxiety."}, {"text": " However, anxiety also involves other symptoms, such as sweating, trembling, nausea, and a racing heartbeat. Anxiety may also involve fears \u2014 fear of losing control and fear of illness or dying. In addition, people with excessive anxiety avoid various situations, people, animals, or objects to an unnecessary degree."}, {"text": " Psychologists and psychiatrists have compiled a list of seven major categories of anxiety disorders as follows: \u2713 Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) \u2713 Social phobia \u2713 Panic disorder \u2713 Agoraphobia \u2713 Specific phobias \u2713 Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) \u2713 Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) You don\u2019t need a full-blown diagnosis to feel that you have some trouble with anxiety."}, {"text": " Many people have more anxiety than they want but don\u2019t completely fit the category of having an official anxiety disorder. Only a mental-health professional can tell you for certain what type of anxiety you have, because various other disorders can look similar.  Generalized anxiety disorder: The common cold of anxiety Some people refer to generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) as the common cold of anxiety disorders because it afflicts more people throughout the world than any other anxiety disorder."}, {"text": " GAD involves a long-lasting, almost constant state of tension and worry. Realistic worries don\u2019t mean you have GAD. For example, if you worry about money and you\u2019ve just lost your job, that\u2019s not GAD; it\u2019s a real-life problem. But if you constantly worry about money and your name is Bill Gates or Warren Buffet, you just may have GAD! You may have GAD if your anxiety has shown up almost every day for the last six months."}, {"text": " You try to stop worrying but you just can\u2019t, and you frequently experience a number of the following problems:  06_574416-ch02.indd 23  3/22/10 9:48 PM  \f24  Part I: Detecting and Exposing Anxiety \u2713 You feel restless, often irritable, on edge, fidgety, or keyed up. \u2713 You get tired easily. \u2713 Your muscles feel tense, especially in your back, neck, or shoulders."}, {"text": " \u2713 You have difficulty concentrating, falling asleep, or staying asleep. Not everyone experiences anxiety in exactly the same way. Some people complain about other problems \u2014 such as twitching, trembling, shortness of breath, sweating, dry mouth, stomach upset, feeling shaky, being easily startled, and having difficulty swallowing \u2014 and fail to realize that they actually suffer from GAD."}, {"text": " The following profile offers an example of what GAD is all about. In a subway, Brian taps his foot nervously. He slept only a few hours last night, tossing, turning, and ruminating about the economy. He\u2019s sure that he\u2019s next in line to lose his job. Even though his boss says that he\u2019s safe, Brian can\u2019t stop worrying."}, {"text": " He believes that he may end up broke and homeless. His back is killing him; he shrugs his shoulders trying to loosen up his tight muscles. He struggles to concentrate on the blog that he\u2019s looking at and realizes that he can\u2019t remember what he just read. He notices his shirt feels damp. He thinks he might be sick."}, {"text": " He is sick \u2014 with worry. Brian has worked steadily at the same company since graduating from college six years ago. His work is highly technical. Most of the senior executives depend on his technology know-how. He has stashed away a nice amount of money for emergencies. Nevertheless, his anxiety has increased over the last year to the point that he notices that he\u2019s making mistakes."}, {"text": " He can\u2019t think; he feels horrible and is in a constant state of distress. Brian suffers from GAD. The economy can make anyone anxious at times. But Brian\u2019s worries seem out of proportion to his real situation. It seems unlikely that he\u2019s in danger of losing his job. However, his extreme anxiety may, in fact, cause him to get in trouble at work."}, {"text": " People with overwhelming anxiety often make careless mistakes because of problems with attention and concentration. GAD takes everyday worries and turns up the volume to full blast.  Social phobia: Avoiding people Those with social phobia fear exposure to public scrutiny. They frequently dread performing, speaking, going to parties, meeting new people, entering groups, using the telephone, writing a check in front of others, eating in public, and/or interacting with those in authority."}, {"text": " They see these situations as painful because they expect to receive humiliating or shameful judgments  06_574416-ch02.indd 24  3/22/10 9:48 PM  \fChapter 2: Examining Anxiety: What\u2019s Normal, What\u2019s Not  25  from others. Social phobics believe they\u2019re somehow defective and inadequate; they assume they\u2019ll bungle their lines, spill their drinks, shake hands with clammy palms, or commit any number of social faux pas and thus embarrass themselves."}, {"text": " They also worry about what others are thinking about them \u2014 so much that they don\u2019t listen well enough to keep a conversation going. Everyone feels uncomfortable or nervous from time to time, especially in new situations. For example, if you\u2019ve been experiencing social fears for less than six months, you may not have social phobia."}, {"text": " A short-term fear of socializing may be a temporary reaction to a new stress such as moving to a new neighborhood or getting a new job. However, you may have social phobia if you experience the following symptoms for a prolonged period: \u2713 You fear situations with unfamiliar people or ones where you may be observed or evaluated in some way."}, {"text": " \u2713 When forced into an uncomfortable social situation, your anxiety increases powerfully. For example, if you fear public speaking, your voice shakes and your knees tremble the moment that you start your speech. \u2713 You realize that your fear is greater than the situation really warrants. For example, if you fear meeting new people, logically you know nothing horrible will happen, but tidal waves of adrenaline and fearful anticipation course through your veins."}, {"text": " \u2713 You avoid fearful situations as much as you can or endure them only with great distress. Check out the following prime example of a social phobic and see whether any of it seems familiar. Quinton, a 35-year-old bachelor, wants a serious relationship. Women consider him attractive and he has a high-paying job."}, {"text": " Quinton\u2019s friends invite him to parties and other social events in an effort to set him up with women. Unfortunately, he detests the idea of going. Quinton conjures up a number of good excuses for backing out. However, his desire to meet potential dates eventually wins. Whenever he imagines scenes of meeting women, he feels intense, anxious anticipation."}, {"text": " When Quinton arrives at the party, he heads to the bar to quell his mounting anxiety. His hands shake as he picks up his first drink. Quickly downing the drink, he orders another in hopes of numbing his emotions. After an hour of nonstop drinking, he feels much braver. He interrupts a cluster of attractive women and spews out a string of jokes that he has memorized for the occasion."}, {"text": " Then he approaches various women throughout the night, sometimes making flirtatious, suggestive comments. His silly, drunken behavior doesn\u2019t get him any dates. The following day, he\u2019s embarrassed and ashamed.  06_574416-ch02.indd 25  3/22/10 9:48 PM  \f26  Part I: Detecting and Exposing Anxiety Quinton has social phobia."}, {"text": " Drug and alcohol abuse often accompany social phobia because people with social phobia feel desperate to quell their anxious feelings. And drugs and alcohol offer a quick fix. Unfortunately, that fix often turns into an addiction.  Panic disorder: Way beyond everyday anxiety Of course, everyone feels a little panicked from time to time."}, {"text": " People often say they feel panicked about an upcoming deadline, an impending presentation, or planning for a party. You\u2019re likely to hear the term used to describe concerns about rather mundane events such as these. But people who suffer with panic disorder are talking about entirely different phenomena."}, {"text": " They have periods of stunningly intense fear and anxiety. If you\u2019ve never had a panic attack, trust us, you don\u2019t want one. The attacks usually last about ten minutes, and many people who have them fully believe that they will die during the attack. Not exactly the best ten minutes of their lives."}, {"text": " Panic attacks normally include a range of robust, attention-grabbing symptoms, such as \u2713 An irregular, rapid, or pounding heartbeat \u2713 Perspiring \u2713 A sense of choking, suffocation, or shortness of breath \u2713 Vertigo or lightheadedness \u2713 Pain or other discomfort in the chest \u2713 A feeling that events are unreal or a sense of detachment \u2713 Numbness or tingling \u2713 Hot or cold flashes \u2713 A fear of impending death, though without basis in fact \u2713 Stomach nausea or upset \u2713 Thoughts of going insane or completely losing control Panic attacks begin with an event that triggers some kind of sensation, such as physical exertion or normal variations in physiological reactions."}, {"text": " This triggering event induces physiological responses, such as increased levels of adrenaline. No problem so far. But the otherwise normal process goes awry at the next step \u2014 when the person who suffers from panic attacks misinterprets the meaning of the physical symptoms. Rather than viewing the physical symptoms as normal, the person with panic disorder sees them as a signal that something dangerous is  06_574416-ch02."}, {"text": "indd 26  3/22/10 9:48 PM  \fChapter 2: Examining Anxiety: What\u2019s Normal, What\u2019s Not  27  happening, such as a heart attack or stroke. That interpretation causes escalating fear and thus more physical arousal. Fortunately, the body can sustain such heightened physical responses only for a while, so it eventually calms down."}, {"text": " Professionals say that in order to have full-blown panic disorder, panic attacks must occur more than once. People with panic disorder worry about when the next panic attack will come and whether they\u2019ll lose control. They often start changing their lives by avoiding certain places or activities."}, {"text": " The good news: Many people have a single panic attack and never have another one. So don\u2019t panic if you have a panic attack. Maria\u2019s story is a good example of a one-time panic attack. Maria resolves to lose 20 pounds by exercising and watching what she eats. On her third visit to the gym, she sets the treadmill to a level six."}, {"text": " Almost immediately, her heart rate accelerates. Alarmed, she decreases the level to three. She starts taking rapid, shallow breaths but feels she can\u2019t get enough air. Sweating profusely and feeling nauseous, she stops the machine and staggers to the locker room. She sits down; the symptoms intensify and her chest tightens."}, {"text": " She wants to scream but can\u2019t get enough air. She\u2019s sure that she\u2019ll pass out and hopes someone will find her before she dies of a heart attack. She hears someone and weakly calls for help. An ambulance whisks her to a nearby emergency room. At the ER, Maria\u2019s symptoms subside, and the doctor explains the results of her examination."}, {"text": " He says that she has apparently experienced a panic attack and inquires about what may have set it off. She answers that she was exercising because of concerns about her weight and health. \u201cAh, that explains it,\u201d the doctor reassures. \u201cYour concerns about health made you hypersensitive to any bodily symptom."}, {"text": " When your heart rate naturally increased on the treadmill, you became alarmed. That fear caused your body to produce more adrenaline, which in turn created more symptoms. The more symptoms you had, the more your fear and adrenaline increased. Knowing how this works may help you; hopefully, in the future, your body\u2019s normal physical variations won\u2019t frighten you."}, {"text": " Your heart\u2019s in great shape. Go back to exercising. \u201cAlso, you might try some simple relaxation techniques; I\u2019ll have the nurse come in and tell you about those. I have every reason to believe that you won\u2019t have another episode like this one. Finally, you may want to read Overcoming Anxiety For Dummies by Drs."}, {"text": " Charles Elliott and Laura Smith (Wiley); it\u2019s a great book!\u201d Maria doesn\u2019t have a diagnosis of panic disorder because she hasn\u2019t experienced more than one attack, and she may never have an attack again. If she believes the doctor and takes his advice, the next time her heart races, she probably won\u2019t get so scared."}, {"text": " She may even use the relaxation techniques that the nurse explained to her.  06_574416-ch02.indd 27  3/22/10 9:48 PM  \f28  Part I: Detecting and Exposing Anxiety  Help! I\u2019m dying! Panic attack symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, and intense fear, often mimic heart attacks. Alarmed, those who experience these terrifying episodes take off in the direction of the nearest emergency room."}, {"text": " Then, after numerous tests come back negative, overworked doctors tell the victim of a panic attack in so many words that \u201cIt\u2019s all in your head.\u201d Many patients with panic attacks doubt the judgment of the physician and strongly suspect that something important was missed or wasn\u2019t found.  The next time an attack occurs, panic attack victims are likely to return to the ER for another opinion again and again."}, {"text": " The repeat visits frustrate people with panic attacks as well as ER staff. However, a simple 20- or 30-minute psychological intervention in the emergency room decreases the repeat visits dramatically. The intervention is pretty simple \u2014 just providing education about what the disorder is all about and describing a few deep relaxation techniques to try when panic hits."}, {"text": "  Agoraphobia: Panic\u2019s companion Approximately half of those who suffer from a panic disorder have an accompanying problem: agoraphobia. Unlike most fears or phobias, this strange disorder usually begins in adulthood. Individuals with agoraphobia live in terror of being trapped. In addition, they worry about having a panic attack, throwing up, or having diarrhea in public."}, {"text": " They desperately avoid situations from which they can\u2019t readily escape, and they also fear places where help may not be readily forthcoming should they need it. The agoraphobic may start with one fear, such as being in a crowd, but in many cases the feared situations multiply to the point that the person fears even leaving home."}, {"text": " As agoraphobia teams up with panic, the double-barreled fears of not getting help and of feeling entombed with no way out can lead to paralyzing isolation. You or someone you love may have agoraphobia if \u2713 You worry about being somewhere where you can\u2019t get out or can\u2019t get help in case something bad happens, like a panic attack."}, {"text": " \u2713 You tremble over everyday things like leaving home, being in large groups of people, or traveling. \u2713 Because of your anxiety, you avoid the places that you fear so much that it takes over your life, and you become a prisoner of your fear. You may have concerns about feeling trapped or have anxiety about crowds and leaving home."}, {"text": " Many people do. But if your life goes on without major changes or constraints, you\u2019re probably not agoraphobic.  06_574416-ch02.indd 28  3/22/10 9:48 PM  \fChapter 2: Examining Anxiety: What\u2019s Normal, What\u2019s Not  29  For example, imagine that you quake at the thought of entering large sports stadiums."}, {"text": " You see images of crowds pushing and shoving, causing you to fall over the railing, landing below, only to be trampled by the mob as you cry out. You may be able to live an entire blissful life avoiding sports stadiums. On the other hand, if you love watching live sports events, or you just got a job as a sports reporter, this fear could be really bad."}, {"text": " Patricia\u2019s story, which follows, demonstrates the overwhelming anxiety that often traps agoraphobics. Patricia celebrates her 40th birthday without having experienced significant emotional problems. She has gone through the usual bumps in the road of life like losing a parent, her child having a learning disability, and a divorce ten years earlier."}, {"text": " She prides herself in coping with whatever cards life deals her. Lately, she feels stressed when shopping at the mall on weekends because of the crowds. She finds a parking spot at the end of a row. As she enters the mall, her sweaty hands leave a smudge on the revolving glass door. She feels as though the crowd of shoppers is crushing in on her, and she feels trapped."}, {"text": " She\u2019s so scared that she flees the store. Over the next few months, her fears spread. Although they started at the mall, fear and anxiety now overwhelm her in crowded grocery stores as well. Later, simply driving in traffic scares her. Patricia suffers from agoraphobia. If not treated, Patricia could end up housebound."}, {"text": " Many times, panic, agoraphobia, and anxiety strike people who are otherwise devoid of serious, deep-seated emotional problems. So if you suffer from anxiety, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019ll need years of psychotherapy. You may not like the anxiety, but you don\u2019t have to think you\u2019re nuts!  Specific phobias: Spiders, snakes, airplanes, and other scary things Many fears appear to be hard-wired into the human brain."}, {"text": " Cave men and women had good reasons to fear snakes, strangers, heights, darkness, open spaces, and the sight of blood \u2014 snakes could be poisonous, strangers could be enemies, a person could fall from a height, darkness could harbor unknown hazards, open spaces could leave a primitive tribe vulnerable to attack from all sides, and the sight of blood could signal a crisis, even potential death."}, {"text": " Fear fuels caution and avoidance of harm. Those with these fears had a better chance of survival than the naively brave. That\u2019s why many of the most common fears today reflect the dangers of the world thousands of years ago. Even today, it makes sense to cautiously identify a spider before you pick it up."}, {"text": " However, sometimes fears rise to a disabling level. You may have a specific phobia if  06_574416-ch02.indd 29  3/22/10 9:48 PM  \f30  Part I: Detecting and Exposing Anxiety \u2713 You have an exaggerated fear of a specific situation or object. \u2713 When you\u2019re in a fearful situation, you experience excessive anxiety immediately."}, {"text": " Your anxiety may include sweating, rapid heartbeat, a desire to flee, tightness in the chest or throat, or images of something awful happening. \u2713 You know the fear is unreasonable. However, kids with specific phobias don\u2019t always know that their phobia is unreasonable. For example, they may really think that all dogs bite."}, {"text": " (See Chapter 19 for more on specific phobias in children.) \u2713 You avoid your feared object or situation as much as you possibly can. \u2713 Because your fear is so intense, you go so far as to change your dayto-day behavior at work, at home, or in relationships. Thus, your fear inconveniences you and perhaps others, and it restricts your life."}, {"text": " Almost two thirds of people fear one thing or another. For the most part, those fears don\u2019t significantly interfere with everyday life. For example, if you fear snakes but don\u2019t run into too many snakes, then your fear can\u2019t really be considered a phobia. However, if your snake fear makes it impossible for you to walk around in your neighborhood, go on a picnic, or enjoy other activities, then it may be a specific phobia."}, {"text": " The following description of Ted\u2019s life is a prime picture of what someone with a specific phobia goes through. Ted trudges up eight flights of stairs each morning to get to his office and tells everyone that he loves the exercise. When Ted passes the elevators on the way to the stairwell, his heart pounds, and he feels a sense of doom."}, {"text": " Ted envisions being boxed inside the elevator \u2014 the doors slide shut, and there\u2019s no escape. In his mind, the elevator box rises on rusty cables, makes sudden jerks up and down, falls freely, and crashes into the basement. Ted has never experienced anything like his fantasy, nor has anyone he knows had this experience."}, {"text": " Ted has never liked elevators, but he didn\u2019t start avoiding them until the past few years. It seems that the longer he stays away from riding them, the stronger his fear grows. He used to feel okay on escalators, but now he finds himself avoiding those as well.

Distinguishing between obsessions and compulsions A person with OCD may exhibit behaviors that include an obsession, a compulsion, or both."}, {"text": " So what\u2019s the difference between obsessions and compulsions? Obsessions are unwelcome, disturbing, and repetitive images, impulses, or thoughts that jump into the mind. For example, a religious man may have a thought urging him to shout obscenities during a church service, or a caring mother may have intrusive thoughts of causing harm to her baby."}, {"text": " Thankfully, people with OCD don\u2019t carry out these kinds of thoughts, but the obsessions haunt those who have them. Most people who have OCD know that their obsessions are not entirely realistic but can\u2019t seem to stop believing them. Compulsions are repetitive actions or mental strategies carried out to temporarily reduce anxiety or distress."}, {"text": " Sometimes, an obsessive thought causes the anxiety; at other times, the anxiety relates to some feared event or situation that triggers the compulsion. For example, a woman may wash her hands literally hundreds of times each day in order to reduce her anxiety about germs, or a man may have an elaborate nighttime ritual of touching certain objects, lining up clothes in a specific way, arranging his wallet next to his keys in a special position, stacking his change, getting into bed in precisely the correct manner, and reading one section of the Bible before turning out the light."}, {"text": " And if he performs any part of the ritual in less than the \u201cperfect\u201d way, he feels compelled to start all over until he gets it right. Otherwise, he worries that he won\u2019t be able to sleep and that something bad may happen to those he cares about.  06_574416-ch02.indd 33  3/22/10 9:48 PM  \f34  Part I: Detecting and Exposing Anxiety Table 2-1 presents some common obsessions and compulsions experienced by those with OCD."}, {"text": "  Table 2-1  Common Obsessions and Compulsions  Obsessions  Compulsions  Worry about contamination, such as from dirt, germs, radiation, and chemicals  Excessive hand-washing or cleaning due to the obsessive fear of contamination  Doubts about having remembered to turn the stove off, lock the doors, and so on  Checking and rechecking to see that the stove is off, doors are locked, and so on  Perverted sexual imagery that causes shame or thoughts that urge one to behave in a socially unacceptable way  Counting or repeating phrases or prayers to prevent oneself from carrying out shameful acts  Unwanted thoughts of harming someone  Repeating rituals over and over again, such as touching things in a particular sequence  Worries about death, bad luck, and catastrophes  Avoiding certain numbers, words, and places associated with death and bad luck  Worries that everything must be \u201cjust so\u201d  Arranging items in particular patterns, alphabetically, or in some symmetrical order  Seeing OCD when it isn\u2019t there You may recall walking to school with your friends and avoiding cracks in the sidewalk."}, {"text": " If you stepped on one, perhaps someone chided, \u201cIf you step on a crack, you\u2019ll break your mother\u2019s back!\u201d And sometimes you walked to school by yourself and that same thought occurred to you, so you avoided stepping on the cracks. Obviously, you knew that stepping on a crack wouldn\u2019t break your mother\u2019s back."}, {"text": " So not stepping on cracks almost qualifies as a compulsion. That\u2019s because you may have done it repeatedly while knowing that it wouldn\u2019t stop anything bad from happening. If you did it simply as a game and it didn\u2019t bother you that much, avoiding cracks was no big deal, and it wasn\u2019t OCD. Besides, kids often have magical or superstitious thinking, which they usually outgrow."}, {"text": " On the other hand, if some part of you really worried that your mother might suffer if you stepped on a crack and if you sometimes couldn\u2019t even get to school because of your worry, you probably had a full-blown compulsion. Many people check the locks more than once, go back to make sure the coffeepot is turned off a couple of extra times, or count stairs or steps unnecessarily."}, {"text": " It\u2019s only when doing these things starts taking too much time and interferes with relationships, work, or everyday life that you really have a problem.  06_574416-ch02.indd 34  3/22/10 9:48 PM  \fChapter 2: Examining Anxiety: What\u2019s Normal, What\u2019s Not  35  Lisa\u2019s story depicts someone with OCD who worries about contamination."}, {"text": " Like many people with OCD, her fears have some chance of coming true, but she greatly exaggerates the risks.

Thus, you may have anxiety along with other emotional disorders. In fact, about half of those with anxiety disorders develop depression, especially if their anxiety goes untreated.

For example, some people hear voices talking to them or see shadowy figures when no one is around. Delusions, another feature of psychosis, also distort reality. Common psychotic delusions include believing that the CIA or aliens are tracking your whereabouts."}, {"text": " Other delusions involve grandiose, exaggerated beliefs, such as thinking you\u2019re Jesus Christ or that you have a special mission to save the world. If you think you hear the phone ringing when you\u2019re drying your hair or in the shower, only to discover that it wasn\u2019t, you\u2019re not psychotic. Most people occasionally hear or see trivial things that aren\u2019t there."}, {"text": " Psychosis becomes a concern only when these perceptions seriously depart from reality. Fortunately, anxiety disorders don\u2019t lead to psychosis. \u2713 Substance abuse: When people develop a dependency on drugs or alcohol, withdrawal may create serious anxiety. The symptoms of drug or alcohol withdrawal include tremors, disrupted sleep, sweating, increased heartbeat, agitation, and tension."}, {"text": " However, if these symptoms only come on in response to a recent cessation of substance use, they don\u2019t constitute an anxiety disorder. Those with anxiety disorders sometimes abuse substances in a misguided attempt to control their anxiety.

Finally, we discuss how some illnesses can cause or mimic anxiety.  Examining the Anxious Brain The brain takes in information about the world through sight, taste, smell, sound, and touch. Constantly scanning the world for meaning, the brain integrates information from the past with the present and plans what actions to take."}, {"text": " For most people, most of the time, the brain does a pretty good job. But for those with chronic anxiety, something goes awry. Billions of nerve cells (neurons) reside in the brain. They\u2019re organized into a variety of complex structures or circuits. Some of these structures are particularly involved in producing feelings of anxiety, fear, and stress."}, {"text": " These brain structures communicate with one another by sending chemical messengers, known as neurotransmitters, back and forth among them.  07_574416-ch03.indd 37  3/22/10 9:48 PM  \f38  Part I: Detecting and Exposing Anxiety In the following sections, we explain how the brain interprets information and what role the brain\u2019s chemicals play in making you anxious."}, {"text": "  Seeing how the brain\u2019s circuits are connected Think of the brain as having many interconnected circuits. One circuit involves the limbic system and the frontal lobes. The limbic system (particularly the amygdala) registers danger and threats and gives rise to reflexive fear responses. The frontal lobes use thought and reason to process incoming information."}, {"text": " For example, the limbic system could set off alarms reflexively upon seeing a snake. However, the frontal lobes may signal the system to calm down as it processes the fact that the snake is in a glass cage. In anxiety disorders, either the limbic system or the frontal lobes (or both) may fail to function properly."}, {"text": " Thus, the limbic system may trigger fear responses too easily and too often, or the frontal lobes may fail to use logic to quell the fears set off by the limbic system. When the brain signals danger, the body responds by getting ready for action. The next section explains the chemical aspects of fear."}, {"text": "  Communicating chemicals Neurotransmitters help nerve cells communicate feelings, fears, emotions, thoughts, and actions through an intricate orchestration. Four major neurotransmitter systems and some of their functions include \u2713 The noradrenergic system, which produces norepinephrine and epinephrine."}, {"text": " It also stimulates organs required in the fight-or-flight response (see the following section). \u2713 The cholinergic system, which activates the noradrenergic neurotransmitters and facilitates formation of memories. \u2713 The dopaminergic system, which is involved in movement and is also related to feelings of pleasure and reward."}, {"text": " Dopamine disruptions cause problems with attention, motivation, and alertness, and appear to be quite important in the development of fear responses. \u2713 The serotonergic system, which is related to moods, anxiety, and aggression. As these neurotransmitters pulse through your brain, the brain circuitry involved in fear and anxiety lights up."}, {"text": " Your body then responds with a fullsystem alert known as the fight-or-flight response.  07_574416-ch03.indd 38  3/22/10 9:48 PM  \fChapter 3: Sorting Through the Brain and Biology  39  Preparing to Fight or Flee When danger presents itself, you reflexively prepare to stand and fight or run like you\u2019ve never run before."}, {"text": " Your body mobilizes for peril in complex and fantastic ways. Figure 3-1 gives you the picture. Your body responds to threats by preparing for action in three different ways: physically, mentally, and behaviorally. \u2713 Physically: The brain sends signals through your nervous system to go on high alert."}, {"text": " It tells the adrenal glands to rev up production of adrenaline and noradrenaline.

Interestingly, objective measures of socioeconomic status were not so predictive of who would get colds. Thus, it seems it\u2019s people\u2019s perception of their socioeconomic ranking that matters, not the actual ranking itself."}, {"text": " These studies show that the mind and body have an intricate relationship. Other research has been consistent with this idea, showing that stress also slows wound healing, diminishes the effectiveness of vaccinations, and increases inflammation. In other words, the way people think about things that happen to them strongly affects their bodies."}, {"text": "  Digestion slows to preserve energy for meeting the challenge, and pupils dilate to improve vision. Blood flow decreases to hands and feet to minimize blood loss if injured and keep up the blood supply to the large muscles. Sweating increases to keep the body cool, and it makes you slippery so aggressors can\u2019t grab hold of you."}, {"text": " All your muscles tense to spring into action. \u2713 Mentally: You automatically scan your surroundings intensely. Your attention focuses on the threat at hand. In fact, you can\u2019t attend to much of anything else. \u2713 Behaviorally: You\u2019re now ready to run or fight. You need that preparation in the face of danger."}, {"text": " When you have to take on a bear, a lion, or a warrior, you\u2019d better have all your resources on high alert.

In addition, psychotherapy that teaches relaxation techniques, biofeedback, and techniques for coping with anxiety and stress also improves IBS symptoms."}, {"text": " So at this point, no one really knows to what extent IBS is caused by physical causes, anxiety, or stress. It\u2019s more likely, however, that the mind and body interact in important ways that can\u2019t always be separated.  Limit or avoid alcohol, which can make you feel tense in the long run. Alcohol may relax you in small quantities, so many people try to self-medicate by imbibing."}, {"text": " However, people with anxiety disorders easily become addicted to it. Furthermore, in excess, alcohol can lead to a variety of anxiety-like symptoms. For example, after a night of heavy drinking, alcohol can leave you feeling more anxious because it clears the system quickly and the body craves more."}, {"text": " That craving can lead to addiction over time. Caffeine can also spell trouble. Some people seem to thrive on triple espressos, but others find themselves up all night with the jitters. Caffeine lurks in most energy drinks as well as chocolate, so be careful if you\u2019re sensitive to the effects of caffeine."}, {"text": " Speaking of energy drinks, these sometimes contain unusually large quantities of not only caffeine but also other stimulants. You\u2019ll see herbal stimulants such as taurine, guarana (loaded with caffeine), ginseng, and ginkgo biloba, among others. Reported adverse effects include nervousness, sleeplessness, abnormal heart rhythms, and seizures."}, {"text": " If you have excessive anxiety, you don\u2019t want to be chugging down these concoctions. Finally, lots of people get nervous after eating too much sugar. Watch kids at birthday parties or Halloween. Adults can have the same reaction.

Some people seem almost immune to developing anxiety, yet it\u2019s possible that life could deal them a blow that challenges their coping abilities in a way they couldn\u2019t expect."}, {"text": " In the story that follows, Bonnie shows how someone can show resilience for many years yet be tipped over the edge by a single traumatic event. Bonnie manages to grow up in a drug war zone without developing terribly distressing symptoms. One night, bullets whiz through her bedroom window and one pierces her abdomen."}, {"text": " She shows surprising resilience during her recovery.

However, when she is raped at the age of 16, she develops post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; see Chapter 2 for more information)."}, {"text": " Bonnie has sustained one trauma too many. Thus, as Bonnie\u2019s example illustrates, you can never know for certain the exact cause of anyone\u2019s anxiety with absolute certainty. However, if you examine someone\u2019s childhood relationship with her parents, family history, and the various events in her life (such as accidents, war, disease, and so on), you can generally come up with good ideas as to why anxiety now causes problems."}, {"text": " If you have anxiety, think about which of the causes of anxiety have contributed to your troubles. What difference does it make where your anxiety comes from? Overcoming anxiety doesn\u2019t absolutely require knowledge of where it originated. The remedies change little whether you were born with anxiety or acquired it much later in your life."}, {"text": " The benefit of identifying the source of your anxiety lies in helping you realize anxiety isn\u2019t something you brought on yourself. Anxiety develops for a number of good, solid reasons, which we elaborate on in the following sections. The blame doesn\u2019t belong with the person who has anxiety. Guilt and self-blame only sap you of energy."}, {"text": " They drain resources and keep your focus away from the effort required for challenging anxiety. By contrast, self-forgiveness and self-acceptance energize and even motivate your efforts (we cover these ideas later in the chapter).  It\u2019s in my genes! If you suffer from excessive worries and tension, look at the rest of your family."}, {"text": " Of those who have an anxiety disorder, typically about a quarter of their relatives suffer along with them.

Maybe it has nothing to do with their genes. Various researchers have studied siblings and twins who live together to verify that genes do play an important role as to how people experience and cope with anxiety. As predicted, identical twins were far more similar to each other in terms of anxiety than fraternal twins or other siblings."}, {"text": " But even if you\u2019re born with a genetic predisposition toward anxiety, other factors \u2014 such as environment, peers, and how your parents raised you \u2014 enter into the mix.  It\u2019s how I was raised! Blaming parents for almost anything that ails you is easy. Parents usually do the best they can. Raising children poses a formidable task."}, {"text": " So in most cases, parents don\u2019t deserve as much blame as they receive. However, they do hold responsibility for the way that you were brought up to the extent that it may have contributed to your woes. Three parenting styles appear to foster anxiety in children: \u2713 Over-protectors: These parents shield their kids from every imaginable stress or harm."}, {"text": " If their kids stumble, they swoop them up before they even hit the ground. When their kids get upset, they fix the problem. Not surprisingly, their kids fail to find out how to tolerate fear, anxiety, or frustration. \u2713 Over-controllers: These parents micro-manage all their children\u2019s activities."}, {"text": " They direct every detail from how they should play to what they should wear to how they solve arithmetic problems. They discourage independence and fertilize dependency and anxiety. \u2713 Inconsistent responders: The parents in this group provide their kids with erratic rules and limits. One day, they respond with understanding when their kids have trouble with their homework; the next day, they explode when their kids ask for help."}, {"text": " These kids fail to discover the connection between their own efforts and a predictable outcome. Therefore, they feel that they have little control over what happens in life. It\u2019s no wonder that they feel anxious.

The world today moves at a faster pace than ever, and the workweek has gradually inched upward rather than the other way around. Modern life is filled with both complexity and danger. Perhaps that\u2019s why mental-health workers see more people with anxiety-related problems than ever before."}, {"text": " Four specific types of events can trigger a problem with anxiety, even in someone who has never suffered from it much before: \u2713 Unanticipated threats: Predictability and stability counteract anxiety; uncertainty and chaos fuel it.

Nevertheless, he lives from paycheck to paycheck with little left for savings."}, {"text": " A freak slip on an icy patch of sidewalk disables him for six weeks, and he has insufficient sick leave to cover his absence.

Now, she worries incessantly that something is wrong with her; perhaps she\u2019ll never have the life she envisioned for herself. \u2713 Terrorizing trauma: No one ever wants to experience a horrifying or even life-threatening experience."}, {"text": " Unfortunately, these bitter pills do happen. Horrific accidents, acts of terrorism, pandemics, natural disasters, battlefield injuries, and violence have occurred for centuries, and we suspect they always will. When they do, severe problems with anxiety often emerge.

Their anxiety is bad enough, but they also pound on themselves because they have anxiety."}, {"text": " Such self-abuse involves harsh, critical judgments. If you do this to yourself, we suggest that you try the following approach to self-acceptance. Start by making a list of all the likely causes of your problems with anxiety. First, list any possible genetic contributions that you can think of in your relatives who may suffer from anxiety."}, {"text": " Then review how your parents may have either modeled anxiety or instilled it in you because of their harsh or unpredictable parenting style. Then review events in your world from the distant to recent past that were highly anxiety-arousing. Finally, after you list the likely culprits that led to your distress, ask yourself some questions like the ones that follow: \u2713 Did I ask for my anxiety? \u2713 Was there ever a time in my life that I actually wanted to feel anxious? \u2713 Am I primarily to blame for my worries? \u2713 What percentage of the blame can I realistically assign to myself as opposed to genes, parenting, and events, both old and new? \u2713 If a couple of friends of mine had troubles with anxiety, what would I say to them? \u2022 Would I think they were to blame? \u2022 Would I think as ill of them as I do myself? \u2713 Does thinking badly about myself help me to get over my anxiety? \u2713 If I decided to stop pummeling myself, would I have more energy for tackling my problems? These questions can help you move toward self-acceptance and discover that having anxiety has nothing to do with your worth or value as a human being."}, {"text": " Then you just might lighten up on yourself a little. We recommend it highly. Mind you, people get down on themselves at times. But chronic, unrelenting self-abuse is another matter. If you find yourself completely unable to let go of self-abuse, you may want to seek professional help (see the related section at the end of this chapter)."}, {"text": " You can read more about self-acceptance in Chapter 13.

During this phase, one wants to develop a plan for dealing with both expected and unexpected problematic events. Termination: The change has become habit, so much so that relapse is less likely and further work isn\u2019t particularly necessary. These stages look like a straight line from precontemplation to termination, but what these psychologists found is that people bounce around the stages in various ways."}, {"text": " They may go from contemplation to action without having made adequate preparation.

After all, you already know full well that you\u2019re anxious. Watching your worries is a good idea because it starts the process of change. You discover important patterns, triggers, and insights into your anxiety. Observing anxiety fulfills several useful functions. First, monitoring forces you to be aware of your emotions."}, {"text": " Avoiding and running away from troubling emotions only causes them to escalate. Second, you\u2019ll see that your anxiety goes up and down throughout the day \u2014 which isn\u2019t quite as upsetting as thinking it rules every moment of your life. And you\u2019re likely to discover that recording your ratings can help you to take charge and feel more in control of what\u2019s going on inside of you."}, {"text": " Finally, keeping track helps you see how you\u2019re progressing in your efforts to quell your distress. Track your anxiety in a notebook for a few weeks. Notice patterns or differences in intensity. Carry your anxiety-tracking notebook with you, and try to fill it out at the same time each day. On a scale of one to ten, ten being total panic and one being complete calm, rate the level of anxiety you experience around the same time in the morning, then again in the afternoon, and later in the evening."}, {"text": " Virginia\u2019s story shows you how tracking anxiety can be helpful.

People with anxiety often have distortions in the way they perceive events, and this approach helps you correct those distortions."}, {"text": " For example, an anxious client may be overestimating the risks involved with flying.

Don\u2019t hesitate to inquire about the nature of your treatment plan \u2014 that plan should make sense to you. Most therapists take a few weeks getting to know you before they formulate an entire plan."}, {"text": " If you\u2019re uncomfortable for any reason, by all means seek a second opinion from another therapist.

Then, we discuss how to tune your thoughts and feelings.  Blocking the blues People often have trouble identifying and labeling their feelings and emotions, especially negative ones. Actually, the difficulty makes sense for two reasons."}, {"text": " First, emotions often hurt. No one wants to feel profound sadness, grief, anxiety, or fear. One simple solution is to avoid feelings entirely, and many creative ways to avoid emotion are available. Unfortunately, most of these methods can be destructive: \u2713 Workaholism: Some folks work all the time rather than think about what\u2019s disturbing them."}, {"text": " \u2713 Alcoholism and drug abuse: When people feel bad, numbing their emotions with drugs and alcohol provides a temporary, artificial emotional lift; of course, habitually doing so can lead to addiction, ill health, and sometimes, even death. \u2713 Denial and repression: One strategy for not feeling is to fool yourself by pretending that nothing is wrong."}, {"text": " Denial is often thought to be a conscious process whereas repression is done outside of people\u2019s awareness, but the result is pretty much the same. \u2713 Sensation seeking: High-risk activities, such as sexual promiscuity and compulsive gambling, can all push away distress for a while. \u2713 Distraction: Athletics, entertainment, hobbies, television, surfing the Internet, and many other activities can cover up bad feelings."}, {"text": " Unlike the preceding strategies, distraction can be a good thing. It\u2019s only when distractions are used in excess to cover up and avoid feelings that they become problematic.  10_574416-ch05.indd 66  3/22/10 9:49 PM  \fChapter 5: Becoming a Thought Detective  67  The price of ignoring your feelings In Gone with the Wind, Scarlet O\u2019Hara says time and again, \u201cI\u2019ll think about that tomorrow."}, {"text": " After all, tomorrow is another day.\u201d What a nice, easy solution to tough times \u2014 shove the issue out of the way. But we\u2019re discovering more about the costs of avoiding and repressing emotions. According to researchers at Adelphi University and the University of Michigan, people who  declare themselves as mentally healthy over the years when other evidence shows they\u2019re not have higher heart rates and blood pressure in response to stress than folks who own up to their emotional difficulties or those who truly don\u2019t have problems at the time."}, {"text": " Studies also show that when people write about their emotions on a daily basis, their immune system improves. Amazing stuff.  The second reason that identifying, expressing, and labeling feelings is such a struggle for people is because they\u2019re taught from an early age that they \u201cshouldn\u2019t\u201d feel certain feelings."}, {"text": " Parents, teachers, friends, and relatives bombard kids with \u201cdon\u2019t feel\u201d messages.

The problem with the habitual tendency to avoid feelings is that you don\u2019t find out how to cope with or resolve the underlying issue."}, {"text": " Chronic avoidance creates a certain kind of low-level stress that builds over time.  Getting in touch with your feelings Noticing your emotions can help you gain insight and discover how to cope more effectively.

Jim: Well, I couldn\u2019t believe she could accuse me of that."}, {"text": " Dr. Wolfe: I wonder if we should take some time to help you get in touch with your feelings? Perhaps Jim is extremely anxious and worried that his wife will leave him, or he may be angry with her. Maybe her stinging criticism hurt him. Whatever the feeling, both Jim and Dr. Wolfe could find out plenty from knowing what emotion accompanies his upset."}, {"text": " This example shows that people may not always know how to describe what they\u2019re feeling. If you don\u2019t always know what you\u2019re feeling, that\u2019s okay.

Notice all your physical sensations."}, {"text": " Tune in to sensations of tension, queasiness, tightness, dizziness, or heaviness. No matter what you find, just sit with the sensations a while.

They may be trying to tell you something."}, {"text": " Bad feelings only cause problems when you feel bad chronically and repeatedly in the absence of a clear threat. Anxiety and fear also have a positive function: They alert your mind and body to danger and prepare you to respond (see Chapter 3 for more on the fight-or-flight concept). For example, if King Kong knocks on your door, adrenaline floods your body and mobilizes you to either fight or run like your life depends on it, because it does! That\u2019s good for situations like that."}, {"text": " But if you feel like King Kong is knocking on your door on a regular basis and he\u2019s not even in the neighborhood, your anxious feelings cause you more harm than good. Whether or not King Kong is knocking at your door, identifying anxious, fearful, or worried feelings can help you deal with them far more effectively than avoiding them."}, {"text": " When you know what\u2019s going on, you can focus on what to do about your predicament more easily than you can when you\u2019re sitting in the dark.  Getting in touch with your thoughts Just as some people don\u2019t have much idea about what they\u2019re feeling, others have trouble knowing what they\u2019re thinking when they\u2019re anxious, worried, or stressed."}, {"text": " Because thoughts have a powerful influence on feelings, psychologists like to ask their clients what they were thinking when they started to feel upset.

I don\u2019t think I really had any thoughts actually. Dr. Baker: That\u2019s possible. Sometimes our thoughts escape us for a while. But I wonder, if you think about it now, what did those comments mean to you? What did you think would happen? Susan: I\u2019m shaking right now just thinking about it."}, {"text": " As this example illustrates, people don\u2019t always know what\u2019s going on in their heads when they feel anxious. Sometimes you may not have clear, identifiable thoughts when you feel worried or stressed. That\u2019s perfectly normal. The challenge is to find out what the stressful event means to you. That will tell you what your thoughts are."}, {"text": " Consider the prior example. Susan may have felt panicked because she feared losing her job, or she may have thought the supervisor\u2019s criticism meant that she was incompetent.

Keep in mind that gathering evidence when you\u2019re feeling really anxious isn\u2019t always easy to do."}, {"text": " At those times, it\u2019s hard to consider that your thoughts may be inaccurate. When that\u2019s the case, you\u2019re better off waiting until you calm down before hunting for the evidence.

Use the following questions to come up with disputing evidence: \u2713 Have I had thoughts like these at other times in my life? Have my dire predictions come true? \u2713 Do I have experiences that would contradict my thoughts in any way? \u2713 Is this situation really as awful as I\u2019m making it out to be? \u2713 A year from now, how much concern will I have with this issue? \u2713 Am I thinking this will happen just because I\u2019m feeling anxious and worried? Am I basing my conclusion mostly on my feelings or on the true evidence? \u2713 Am I assuming something without any solid evidence for my negative thought? Feelings are always valid in the sense that you feel what you feel, but they\u2019re not evidence for supporting anxious thoughts."}, {"text": " For example, if you feel extremely anxious about taking a test, the anxiety is not evidence of how you will perform. These evidence-gathering questions can help you discover evidence against your anxious or worrisome thoughts, because an anxious mind already knows the evidence that supports anxious thoughts."}, {"text": " To see how this works, take a look at Andrew\u2019s notes in Table 5-2. Andrew was afraid that someone would hurt him and jumped to conclusions without evidence to support those conclusions.

If they don\u2019t, you just may start taking them less seriously, and your anxiety could drop a notch or two."}, {"text": " Although charting your anxious thoughts and weighing the evidence just once may prove to be helpful, practice magnifies the effect. Mastering any new skill always requires practice. The longer you stay at it and the more times you chart your anxious thoughts versus the real evidence, the more benefit you\u2019ll gain."}, {"text": " Many of our clients find that charting these out regularly for three or four months alleviates a considerable amount of their negative feelings.  Rethinking risk Another important way to challenge your anxious thoughts is to look at how you assess the likelihood that an event may occur. When you feel anxious, like many people, you may overestimate the odds of unwanted events actually occurring."}, {"text": " It\u2019s easy to do.

That\u2019s why it\u2019s useful to think about the real, objective odds of your predicted catastrophe. Thoughts are just thoughts. Subject them to a reality test. When you find yourself making negative predictions about the future \u2014 such as the horrible time you\u2019ll have at a party, your odds of failing a test, or the likelihood that you\u2019ll end up in financial ruin \u2014 ask yourself the following reassessment of risk questions: \u2713 How many times have I predicted this outcome, and how many times has it actually happened to me? \u2713 How often does this happen to people I know? \u2713 If someone I know made this prediction, would I agree? \u2713 Am I assuming this will happen just because I fear that it will, or is there a reasonable chance that it will really happen? \u2713 Would people pay me to predict the future? \u2713 Do I have any experiences from my past that would suggest my dire prediction is unlikely to occur? In addition to asking these questions, whenever possible, look up the statistical evidence as it relates to your fears."}, {"text": " Of course, you can\u2019t always find statistics that help you. Nevertheless, the answers to the preceding questions will help you reassess your true risk and stop habitually making catastrophic predictions about the future.  What are the odds? On any given day, the odds of being struck by lightning are about 1 in 250 million, and the lifetime odds of being killed by a few other means are as follows: \u2713 By a dog: About 1 in 700,000 \u2713 By a poisonous snake, lizard, or spider: About 1 in 700,000 \u2713 In air or space transport: About 1 in 5,000  Notice how the actual odds don\u2019t match very well with what people fear most."}, {"text": " Many more people fear thunderstorms, snakes, spiders, and flying in airplanes than driving a car or being killed by a firearm. It doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense, does it? Finally, we should note that your individual odds may vary.

So how can Dennis assess the odds realistically? Naturally, he answers the reassessment of risk questions and starts to change his anxious thoughts. In doing so, Dennis comes to realize that he and his wife have never actually ruined a dinner, although he has predicted it numerous times before."}, {"text": " Furthermore, he tested his second prediction that his guests would feel horrified if the dinner did turn out badly. He recalled that one time he and Linda attended a barbeque where the meat was burned to the extent that it was inedible.

Bosses hand out bad evaluations. Airplanes crash. Some days are just \u201cbad hair days.\u201d Ships sink. People stumble and get laughed at. Some lose their jobs. Lovers break up.

First we show you how to cope with smaller, everyday worries, and then we address worst-case scenarios."}, {"text": "  Small-potatoes scenarios What do people worry about? Most of the time they worry about inconsequential, small-potatoes scenarios.

Mostly, he worries about committing a social blunder."}, {"text": " Before parties, he obsesses over what to wear. Will he look too dressed up or too casual? Will he know what to say? What if he says something stupid and people laugh? As you can imagine, Gerald feels miserable at social events. When he walks into a crowd, he feels as though a spotlight has turned his way and everyone in the room is staring at him."}, {"text": " He imagines that people not only focus on him but that they also judge him negatively. Sammy worries as much as Gerald; he just has a different set of worries. Sammy obsesses over the idea that he\u2019ll lose control and have to run away from wherever he is. If he\u2019s sitting in a classroom, he wonders whether he\u2019ll get so anxious that he\u2019ll have to leave, and of course, he assumes everyone will know why he left and think something is terribly wrong with him."}, {"text": " If he\u2019s at a crowded shopping mall, he\u2019s afraid he\u2019ll \u201close it\u201d and start screaming and running out of control. Carol is a journalist. She feels anxiety almost every day. She feels pressure in her chest when each deadline approaches and dreads the day when she fails to get her story in on time."}, {"text": " Making matters worse, she sometimes has writer\u2019s block and can\u2019t think of the next word to type for 15 or 20 minutes; all the while, the clock advances and the deadline nears. She\u2019s seen colleagues lose their jobs when they consistently failed to reach their deadlines, and she fears meeting the same fate one day."}, {"text": " It\u2019s hard for Carol to stop thinking about her deadlines. What do Gerald, Sammy, and Carol have in common? First, they all have considerable anxiety, stress, and tension. They worry almost every single day of their lives. They can\u2019t imagine the horror of dealing with the possibility of their fears coming true."}, {"text": " But, more importantly, they worry about events that happen all the time and that people manage to cope with when they do. Gerald, Sammy, and Carol all underestimate their own ability to cope. What if Gerald spills something at a party and people around him notice? Would Gerald fall to the floor unable to move? Would people point and laugh at him? Not likely."}, {"text": " He\u2019d probably blush, feel embarrassed, and clean up the mess. The party and Gerald\u2019s life would go on. Even if a few rude people laughed at Gerald, most would forget the incident and certainly wouldn\u2019t view Gerald any differently.  10_574416-ch05.indd 79  3/22/10 9:49 PM  \f80  Part II: Battling Anxiety Sammy panics over the possibility that his feelings may overwhelm him."}, {"text": " He worries that he\u2019ll have to run from wherever he is and look foolish in doing so. The fact that this has never happened to him doesn\u2019t stop Sammy\u2019s worrying. Carol, on the other hand, has a bigger worry. Her worst-case scenario involves losing her job. That sounds serious. What would she do if she lost her job? Whether you experience small- or medium-sized worries (small- or mediumpotato scenarios), you can use the following coping questions to discover your true ability to cope."}, {"text": " The answers to these questions help you deal with your own worst fears. 1. Have I ever dealt with anything like this in the past? 2. How much will this affect my life a year from now? 3. Do I know people who\u2019ve coped with something like this, and how did they do it? 4.

Have I ever dealt with anything like this in the past? No, I\u2019ve never lost a job before."}, {"text": " This first question doesn\u2019t help me discover any better ways of coping, but it does help me see the possibility that I\u2019ve been overestimating the risks of losing my job. 2.

Maybe I\u2019ll quit my job now and do that! It\u2019s amazing how often asking yourself these questions can eliminate the catastrophic consequences you associate with your imagined worry scenarios. Answering these questions can help you see that you can deal with the vast majority of your worries \u2014 at least the small- to medium-sized potatoes."}, {"text": " But how about the worst-case scenarios (the really, really big potatoes)? Could you cope with real disasters?  Worst-case scenarios Some peoples\u2019 fears involve issues that go way beyond social embarrassment or temporary financial loss. Severe illness, death, terror, natural disasters, disfigurement, major disabilities, and loss of a loved one are worst-case scenarios."}, {"text": " How would you possibly cope with one of these? We\u2019re not going to tell you it would be easy, because it wouldn\u2019t be. Marilyn\u2019s mother and grandmother both died of breast cancer.

Almost every day of her adult life, she worries about her health."}, {"text": " She insists on monthly checkups, and every stomach upset, bout of fatigue, or headache becomes an imagined tumor.

Unlike her mother and grandmother, Marilyn goes for yearly mammograms, and she performs regular self-exams."}, {"text": " Not only that, she exercises regularly and eats a much healthier diet than her mother or grandmother did. Marilyn realistically has a chance of getting breast cancer. How would she possibly cope with this worst-case scenario? You may be surprised to discover that the same questions used to deal with the small-potatoes scenarios can help you deal with the worst-case scenarios."}, {"text": " Take a look at how Marilyn answered our five coping questions: 1. Have I ever dealt with anything like this in the past? Unfortunately, yes. I helped my mother when she was going for chemotherapy. It was horrible, but I do remember laughing with her when her hair fell out. I understand chemotherapy isn\u2019t nearly as bad as it used to be."}, {"text": " I never felt closer to my mother than during that time. We talked out many important issues. 2.

These first two questions focus Marilyn on the possibility of getting cancer. Even though she obsesses and worries about cancer, the intensity of the anxiety has prevented her from ever contemplating how she would deal with cancer if it actually occurred."}, {"text": " Although she certainly hates the thought of chemotherapy or surgery, after she imagines the possibility, she realizes she could probably cope with them. The more you avoid a fear, the more terrifying it becomes. 3. Do I know people who\u2019ve coped with something like this, and how did they do it? Of course, my mother died of breast cancer."}, {"text": " But during the last three years of her life, she enjoyed each moment. She got closer to all her kids and made many new friends. It\u2019s funny, but now that I think about it, I think she was happier during that time than any other time I can remember. 4. Do I know anyone I could turn to for help or support? I know of a cancer support group in town."}, {"text": " And my husband and sister would do anything for me. 5. Can I think of a creative new possibility that could result from this challenge? I never thought of cancer as a challenge; it was a curse. But I guess I realize now that I can choose to be anxious and worried about it or just take care of myself and live life fully."}, {"text": " If I do get cancer, I can hopefully help others like my mother did, and I\u2019ll use the time I have in a positive way. Besides, there\u2019s a good chance that I could beat cancer, and with medical advances, those chances improve all the time. Meanwhile, I\u2019m going to make sure that I don\u2019t wait until my final days to get close to my family."}, {"text": " When you have anxiety about something dreadful happening, it\u2019s important to stop avoiding the end of the story. Go there. The more you avoid contemplating the worst, the bigger the fear gets.

What is it about this eventuality that makes you think you absolutely could not cope and could not possibly stand it? Okay, I can imagine two different plane crashes. In one, the plane would explode and I probably wouldn\u2019t even know what happened."}, {"text": " In the other, something would happen to the engine, and I\u2019d experience several minutes of absolute terror. That\u2019s what I really fear. 2. Is it possible that you really could deal with it? Could I deal with that? I guess I never thought of that before; it seemed too scary to contemplate. If I really put myself in the plane, I\u2019d probably be gripping the seat, maybe even screaming, but I guess it wouldn\u2019t last for long."}, {"text": " I suppose I could stand almost anything for a short while.

The following list gives you a small sample of extremist words: agonizing, appalling, awful, devastating, disastrous, horrible, and unbearable."}, {"text": " Of course, reality can be horrible, appalling, and downright awful. It would be hard to describe the Holocaust, September 11th, famine, or a worldwide pandemic in milder terms. However, all too often, extremist words like these reshape reality.

Many folks take the critical voice that they heard in childhood and turn it on themselves, often magnifying the critique in the process. Critical words come in three varieties, although they overlap, and sometimes a particular word can belong in more than one category: \u2713 Judgments: These are harsh judgments about yourself or what you do."}, {"text": " For example, when you make a human mistake and call it an utter failure, you\u2019re judging your actions rather than merely describing them. Words like bad, inadequate, stupid, pathetic, or despicable are judgments. \u2713 Commandments: This category contains words that dictate absolute, unyielding rules about your behavior or feelings."}, {"text": " If you tell yourself that you should or must take a particular action, you\u2019re listening to an internal drill sergeant. This punishing drill sergeant tolerates no deviation from a strict set of rules. \u2713 Labels: Finally, self-critical labels put the icing on the cake. Words like loser, pig, monster, jerk, and failure come to mind as disturbing labels people sometimes put on themselves like a name tag worn at a party."}, {"text": " Consider Steve, who makes a minor mistake in his checkbook and launches into a self-critical tirade.

Right now, I can\u2019t know for certain whether I\u2019ll panic the next time I\u2019m in a crowd. I may panic, and I may not. If I do, it\u2019s not the worst thing in the world, and I won\u2019t die from it.  Judging the judge Words that judge, command, or label, such as should, must, failure, fool, undeserving, and freak, inflict unnecessary pain and shame on their recipients."}, {"text": " You may hear these words from others or from your own critic within. Labels and judgments describe a person as a whole, but people usually use them to describe a specific action. For example, if you make a mistake, you may say to yourself, \u201cI can\u2019t believe that I could be such an idiot!\u201d If you do, you just made a global evaluation of your entire being based on a single action."}, {"text": " Is that useful? Clearly, it\u2019s not accurate, and most importantly, the judgment doesn\u2019t lead you to feel calm or serene.  11_574416-ch06.indd 97  3/22/10 9:50 PM  \f98  Part II: Battling Anxiety Like the other types of worry words, commandments don\u2019t inspire motivation and improved performance."}, {"text": " Yet people use these words for that very purpose. They think that saying \u201cI must or should\u201d will help them, but these words are more likely to make them feel guilty or anxious. Self-scolding merely increases guilt and anxiety, and guilt and anxiety inevitably decrease both motivation and performance."}, {"text": " Try replacing your judging, commanding, and labeling words with more reasonable, accurate, and supportable alternatives. Consider the following examples: \u2713 Judging: I got a pathetic score on my ACT test. I must be stupid. Reasonable alternative: It wasn\u2019t the score that I wanted, but I can study more and retake it."}, {"text": " \u2713 Commanding: I must have a happy marriage. I should have what it takes to keep it happy. Reasonable alternative: Much as I\u2019d like to have a happy marriage, I was okay before I met my wife, and I can learn to be okay again if I have to.

Yet as with other worry words, only rarely do they convey absolute truth."}, {"text": " Nevertheless, victim words can become what are known as self-fulfilling prophecies. If you think a goal is impossible, you\u2019re not likely to achieve it. If you think that you\u2019re powerless, you won\u2019t draw on your coping resources. As an alternative, consider the logic of your victim words. Is there anything at all that you can do to remedy or at least improve your problem? Gather evidence for refuting victim words that appear in your self-talk."}, {"text": " Ask yourself whether you\u2019ve ever managed to cope with a similar situation before.

A few people rarely become anxious at all."}, {"text": " This chapter explains why different people respond to the same event in extremely different ways. We show you how certain beliefs or assumptions about yourself and the world cause you to feel the way you do about what happens. These beliefs are also called schemas. One way to think about these schemas or beliefs is to think of them as lenses or glasses that you look through."}, {"text": " As you know, sometimes lenses can be cloudy, dirty, smoky, cracked, distorted, rose-colored, or clear. Some schema lenses make people scared or anxious when they see their world through them. We call those anxious schemas or agitating assumptions. We show you how certain anxious schemas generate excessive worry and anxiety."}, {"text": " These beliefs come primarily from your life experiences \u2014 they don\u2019t mean you\u2019re defective. Of course, as discussed in Chapter 3 and elsewhere, all aspects of anxiety are also influenced by biological factors. The questionnaire in this chapter helps you discover which assumptions may agitate and create anxiety in you."}, {"text": " We provide ways for you to challenge those anxious schemas. Replacing your agitating assumptions with calming schemas can reduce your anxiety.  12_574416-ch07.indd 101  3/22/10 9:50 PM  \f102  Part II: Battling Anxiety We consider the terms anxious schemas and agitating assumptions equivalent, but we get bored easily, so we like to mix them up."}, {"text": "  Understanding Agitating Assumptions A schema is something that you presume to be correct without question. You don\u2019t think about such assumptions or schemas; rather, you take them for granted as basic truths. For example, you probably believe that fall follows summer and that someone who smiles at you is friendly and someone who scowls at you isn\u2019t."}, {"text": " You assume without thinking that a red light means stop and a green light means go. Your assumptions provide a map for getting you through life quickly and efficiently. And that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. Your schemas guide you through your days with less effort. For example, most people assume their paychecks will arrive more or less on time."}, {"text": " That assumption allows them to plan ahead, pay bills, and avoid unnecessary worry. If people didn\u2019t make this assumption, they\u2019d constantly check with their payroll department or boss to ensure timely delivery of their checks to the annoyance of all concerned. Unfortunately, the schema of expecting a paycheck is shattered when jobs are scarce or layoffs increase."}, {"text": " Understandably, people with expectations of regular paychecks feel pretty anxious when their assumptions don\u2019t hold true. Similarly, most people have assumptions (or schemas) about food. They assume that the food sold in the grocery store is safe to eat \u2014 in spite of occasional news reports about tainted food showing up in stores."}, {"text": " On the other hand, food sold on a street corner in a third-world country might be assumed to be less safe to eat. Many tourists would avoid such food even if was actually fine. So, while people act on their schemas and assumptions, they\u2019re not always correct in doing so. As you can see, sometimes schemas fail to provide useful information."}, {"text": " They may even distort reality so much that they arouse considerable distress. For example, before giving a speech, you may tremble, quiver, and sweat. You may worry that you\u2019ll stumble over your words, drop your notes, or even worse, faint from fear. Even though these things have seldom happened when you\u2019ve previously given speeches, you always assume that they will this time."}, {"text": " That dread of embarrassment comes from an anxious schema. Anxious schemas assume the worst about yourself or the world \u2014 and usually they\u2019re incorrect. When activated, agitating assumptions cause anxiety and worry. Unfortunately, most people don\u2019t even know they have these schemas. Therefore, agitating assumptions can go unchallenged for many years, leaving them free to fuel anxiety."}, {"text": "  12_574416-ch07.indd 102  3/22/10 9:50 PM  \fChapter 7: Busting Up Your Agitating Assumptions  103  Sizing Up Anxious Schemas Perhaps you\u2019re curious as to whether you hold any anxious schemas. People usually don\u2019t even know if they have these troubling beliefs, so they don\u2019t question them. Challenging agitating assumptions has to start with knowing which ones you have."}, {"text": " In the following sections, we identify five anxious schemas and then provide a quiz to help you determine whether you suffer from any of them.  Recognizing schemas In our work with clients, we\u2019ve found that five major anxious schemas plague them: \u2713 Perfectionism: Perfectionists assume that they must do everything right or they will have failed totally, and the consequences will be devastating."}, {"text": " They ruminate over minor details. \u2713 Approval: Approval addicts assume they must win the approval of others at any cost to themselves. They can\u2019t stand criticism. \u2713 Vulnerability: Those afflicted with the vulnerability assumption feel at the mercy of life\u2019s forces. They worry all the time about possible disasters."}, {"text": " \u2713 Control: Those with the control assumption feel that they can\u2019t trust or rely on anyone but themselves. They always want to be the driver \u2014 never the passenger. \u2713 Dependency: Those with the dependency assumption feel they can\u2019t survive on their own and turn to others for help. These anxious schemas have a powerful influence on the way you respond to circumstances."}, {"text": " For example, imagine that the majority of comments you get on a performance review at work are quite positive, but one sentence describes a minor problem. Each schema causes a different reaction: \u2713 If you have the perfectionism schema, you severely scold yourself for your failure. You won\u2019t even see the positive comments."}, {"text": " \u2713 If you have the approval schema, you obsess about whether your boss still likes you. \u2713 If you have the vulnerability schema, you believe that you\u2019re about to lose your job, and then your house and car. \u2713 If you have a control schema, you focus on how working for someone else makes you feel out of control and helpless."}, {"text": " \u2713 If you have the dependency schema, you look to others for support and help. You ask your coworkers to intervene on your behalf with the boss.  12_574416-ch07.indd 103  3/22/10 9:50 PM  \f104  Part II: Battling Anxiety Various individuals react completely differently to the same event, depending on which assumption those individuals hold."}, {"text": " Just imagine the reaction of someone who simultaneously holds several of these schemas. One sentence in a performance review could set off a huge emotional storm of anxiety and distress. You may have one or more of these anxiety-creating schemas or assumptions to one degree or another. Taking the quiz in the following section helps you find out which, if any, anxious schemas you hold."}, {"text": "  Assessing your agitating assumptions In Table 7-1, place a check mark in the column marked \u201cT\u201d if a statement is true or mostly true as a description of you; conversely, place a check mark in the column marked \u201cF\u201d if a statement is false or mostly false as it pertains to you. Please don\u2019t mark your statement as \u201cT\u201d or \u201cF\u201d simply based on how you think you should be; instead, answer on the basis of how you really do act and respond to events in your life."}, {"text": "  Table 7-1 T  F  The Anxious Schemas Quiz Perfectionism If I\u2019m not good at something, I\u2019d rather not do it.

I need a great deal of reassurance."}, {"text": " I rarely do things without other people.  Most people endorse one or more of these items as true. So don\u2019t worry too much if you find quite a few statements that apply to you. For example, who doesn\u2019t hate being embarrassed? And most people worry at least a little about the future. So how do you know whether you have a problem with one of these assumptions? You start by looking at each assumption one at a time."}, {"text": " If you checked one or more items as true, that raises the possibility that this assumption causes you some trouble. Just how much trouble depends on how much distress you feel. Ask yourself what makes you feel especially anxious. Does it have to do with one or more items that you checked as true? If so, you probably struggle with that anxious schema."}, {"text": " We cover each schema and ways to overcome it later in this chapter. If you have a number of these agitating assumptions, don\u2019t get down on yourself! You likely developed your anxious schemas for good reasons. You should congratulate yourself for starting to figure out the problem. That\u2019s the first step toward feeling better."}, {"text": "  Coming Down with a Case of Anxious Schemas If you have too much anxiety, one or more agitating assumptions undoubtedly cause you problems.

People acquire these schemas in two completely understandable ways: \u2713 When experiences in childhood prevent the development of a reasonable sense of safety, security, acceptance, or approval \u2713 When shocking, traumatic events shatter previously held assumptions The following sections explain in more detail how these experiences lead to anxious schemas."}, {"text": "  Acquiring assumptions in childhood You may have been one of the lucky ones who glided through childhood feeling loved, accepted, safe, and secure. Perhaps you lived in a home with two loving parents, a dog, a station wagon, and a white picket fence. Or maybe not. You probably didn\u2019t have a perfect childhood."}, {"text": " Not many people do. For the most part, your parents probably did the best they could, but they were human. Perhaps they had bad tempers or ran into financial difficulties. Or possibly, they had addictions or failed to look out for your safety as well as they should have. For these and numerous other reasons, you may have acquired one or more agitating assumptions."}, {"text": " The following example illustrates the most common time in life for anxious schemas to develop: childhood. Harold developed his agitating assumption as a child. Harold\u2019s mother rarely gave him much approval. She harshly criticized almost everything he did. For example, his room was never quite clean enough, and his grades were never quite stellar enough."}, {"text": " Even when he brought his mother a gift, she told him it was the wrong color or size. He felt he could do almost nothing right. Slowly but surely, Harold acquired an agitating assumption \u2014 \u201cI must be absolutely perfect, or I will be a total failure.\u201d Being perfect is pretty hard. So you can imagine why he now feels anxious most of the time."}, {"text": " Notice that Harold\u2019s anxious schema about perfection didn\u2019t come about from a massive, single event. Rather, a series of criticisms and corrections built his schema of perfection up over time. Unfortunately, his schema continues to plague him as an adult. If you have agitating assumptions, you don\u2019t question them."}, {"text": " You believe in them wholeheartedly. Just as Harold assumes the sky is blue, he believes that he\u2019s either perfect or a complete failure. When Harold undertakes a project, he feels intense anxiety due to his morbid fear of making a mistake.

Sometimes, what seems to be a common, though unfortunate, occurrence can lead to an anxious schema."}, {"text": " The following example illustrates how present-day life can create an agitating assumption. Bill had always assumed, like most people do, that working hard and saving his money would assure him a safe, secure financial future and retirement. He has worked at his family\u2019s auto parts and service store for 25 years."}, {"text": " He follows his financial advisor\u2019s advice and, at the age of 50, has half of his money in the stock market.

Then the stock market tanks and Bill sees that his hard-won gains have virtually evaporated."}, {"text": " Eventually, the store closes its doors and Bill looks for work. At the age of 50, he sees that he\u2019s not likely to find something that pays what he used to get from the family business. Instead of looking at ways to develop new skills or options, he sits hopelessly watching the stock market on television for many hours every day."}, {"text": " Bill, formerly confident and self-assured, feels insecure, worried, and obsessed about his financial status. He has formed a new assumption \u2014 a vulnerability schema focused on money. He worries constantly about how he\u2019ll get by financially.

In fact, many people who read our books are therapists or counselors who have skills and tools that keep them on an even keel most of the time."}, {"text": " Nonetheless, anxious schemas can pop up for anyone at any time. The following true story about Dr. Laura Smith (coauthor of this book) is a case in point. One evening Dr. Smith sat in the hair salon. Suddenly, a thug stormed in, demanding that everyone lie on the floor, face down, and hand over their money and jewelry."}, {"text": " He brandished a .44 magnum pistol to emphasize his point. Not long after the incident, Dr. Smith realized that she had acquired the agitating assumption of vulnerability. She found herself worrying about safety much more than she had in the past. She began to nervously scan parking lots and jump at loud noises."}, {"text": " When she found herself waking up from nightmares, she knew the vulnerability assumption was creating trouble and that she needed to do something about it. So she used some of the techniques described in this book, especially Chapter 8. These strategies included gradually returning to the scene of the crime, talking about the crime, and relaxation."}, {"text": " Soon, her vulnerability schema began to fade. By the way, it\u2019s now almost ten years later and she still goes to the same hair salon. Anxious schemas may begin when you\u2019re quite young \u2014 perhaps only 4 or 5 years old \u2014 or they may emerge much later in life. Either way, they cause problems.  Challenging Those Nasty Assumptions: Running a Cost/Benefit Analysis After taking our quiz and finding out about anxious schemas in the previous sections, you now have a better idea about which ones may be giving you trouble."}, {"text": " In the old days, many therapists would have told you that insight is enough. We disagree. Pretend you just took an eye test and found out that you suffer from severe nearsightedness. Wow, you have insight! But what does that change? Not much. You still walk around bumping into the furniture. You\u2019re about to get a prescription for seeing through your problematic assumptions."}, {"text": " It starts with a cost/benefit analysis. This analysis paves the way for making changes. Perhaps you think your perfectionism assumption is good and appropriate. Maybe you believe that you have profited from your perfectionism and that  12_574416-ch07.indd 108  3/22/10 9:50 PM  \fChapter 7: Busting Up Your Agitating Assumptions  109  it has helped you accomplish more in your life."}, {"text": " If so, why in the world would you want to challenge or change it? The answer is simple. You wouldn\u2019t. Therefore, you need to take a cold, hard look at the costs as well as any possible benefits of perfectionism. Only if the costs outweigh the benefits does it make sense to do something about your perfectionism."}, {"text": " After looking at the examples in the next five sections, see the \u201cChallenging your own anxious schemas\u201d section for directions on how to conduct a cost/benefit analysis for your personal problematic anxious schemas.  Analyzing perfection Knowing which problematic anxious schemas lurk in your mind is the first step toward change."}, {"text": " However, just knowing isn\u2019t going to get you there. You need to feel motivated to make changes. Change takes effort, and frankly, it\u2019s downright hard to change. The story about Prudence shows you someone who has the perfection schema and how she finds the motivation to change her assumption through a cost/benefit analysis."}, {"text": " Prudence, a successful trial attorney, works about 70 hours per week.

Prudence is shocked when her doctor tells her that her blood pressure has gone out of control. Her doctor wonders about the stress in her life. She says it\u2019s nothing that she can\u2019t handle."}, {"text": " He inquires about her sleep habits, and she replies, \u201cWhat sleep?\u201d Prudence is in trouble, and she doesn\u2019t even know it. She believes that her high income is due to her relentless standards and that she can\u2019t let up in the slightest way. Prudence has little hope of changing her anxious schema of perfection if she doesn\u2019t face it head on."}, {"text": " Her doctor suggests that she see a counselor, who tells her to run a cost/benefit analysis of her perfection assumption. A cost/benefit analysis starts with listing every imaginable benefit of an agitating assumption. Including every benefit your imagination can possibly conjure up is important. Then, and only then, should you start thinking about the costs of the assumption."}, {"text": " Take a look at Table 7-2 to see what Prudence sees as perfectionism\u2019s benefits.  12_574416-ch07.indd 109  3/22/10 9:50 PM  \f110  Part II: Battling Anxiety  Table 7-2  Cost/Benefit Analysis of Prudence\u2019s Perfectionism Schema: Part 1  Benefits  Costs  My income is higher because of my perfectionism."}, {"text": " I rarely make mistakes.

Prudence\u2019s fondness for her perfectionism is no small wonder. Filling out the benefits in her cost/benefit analysis is easy for her, but what about the costs? Prudence will probably have to expend much more effort to complete the costs, and she may even have to ask other people for ideas."}, {"text": " Now, review in Table 7-3 what she writes after she works at the task and consults others.

That\u2019s caused me to miss deadlines sometimes.  The cost/benefit analysis helps you to know whether you really want to challenge your agitating assumptions. You would probably agree that Prudence\u2019s example shows more costs than benefits."}, {"text": " But wait, it isn\u2019t finished. The final step is to examine carefully whether you would lose all the benefits by changing the assumption. For example, Prudence attributes her high income to her dedication and long work hours. Perhaps she\u2019s partly right, but would her income evaporate if she worked just a little less? Most likely, if she worked less, her income might drop a bit, but with less anxiety, she might increase her efficiency enough to make up the difference."}, {"text": " If she were less irritable, she would be able to retain her secretarial staff and gain efficiency there too. And would Prudence actually start making more mistakes if she relaxed her standards? Research suggests that excessive anxiety decreases performance. With respect to her niece, Prudence isn\u2019t really getting the benefit that she thinks she is, because she\u2019s not around enough to serve as an effective role model."}, {"text": " Finally, more people fear Prudence than admire her. So you see, many times the perceived benefits of an assumption evaporate upon close inspection.  Anxiety: How much is too much? A little bit of anxiety seems to improve performance and reduce mistakes. Some anxiety channels attention and effort to the task at hand."}, {"text": " Without anxiety, people don\u2019t take tasks seriously or prepare sufficiently. However, when perfectionism reaches extreme levels, so does anxiety, and performance drops off. Excessive  12_574416-ch07.indd 111  anxiety interferes with the ability to recall previously learned information, and mistakes multiply."}, {"text": " That\u2019s why people with perfection schemas often have severe test anxiety. They know the material, but their anxiety causes them to forget what they have previously learned. Their fear of imperfection causes what they fear.  3/22/10 9:50 PM  \f112  Part II: Battling Anxiety  Tabulating approval Approval addicts constantly crave admiration and acceptance from others."}, {"text": " They worry about rejection and criticism.

Chapter 2 discusses this disorder, which often starts with obsessive, unwanted thoughts that create anxiety."}, {"text": " People with this problem then try to relieve the anxiety caused by their thoughts by performing one of a number of compulsive acts.

Therefore, for obsessive-compulsive disorder, exposure is only the first step."}, {"text": " Then you must do something even harder \u2014 prevent the compulsive, anxietyrelieving actions. This strategy is called exposure and response prevention (or ERP). The first step, exposure, deals with the obsessional component of OCD \u2014 feared thoughts, images, and impulses. The exposure is often imaginary (see the earlier section \u201cImagining the worst\u201d)."}, {"text": " This may be the only strategy you can use if your obsessions can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t be acted out in real life, as in the following examples: \u2713 Thoughts that tell you to violate your personal religious beliefs \u2713 Repetitive thoughts of harm coming to a family member or loved one \u2713 Frequent worries about burning alive in a home fire \u2713 Unwanted thoughts about getting cancer or some other dreaded disease Proceed as follows: 1."}, {"text": " List your distressing thoughts and images, and then rate each one for the amount of distress it causes. 2.

This approach is quite the opposite of what people with OCD usually do with their unwanted obsessions. Normally, they try to sweep the haunting thoughts out of their minds the moment they appear, but that only succeeds ever so briefly, and it maintains the cycle."}, {"text": " Give imaginary exposure enough time \u2014 keep the thoughts and images in your head long enough for your anxiety to reduce at least 50 percent before moving to the next item. If you also suffer from compulsive acts or avoidance due to obsessive thoughts, it\u2019s now time for the more difficult, second step \u2014 response prevention."}, {"text": " Again, make a staircase or hierarchy of feared events and situations that you typically avoid: a staircase of fear. Then proceed to put yourself in each of those situations, but don\u2019t allow yourself to perform the compulsive act.

If it doesn\u2019t drop that much, stay at least 90 minutes and try not to quit until a minimum of a third of your distress goes away. Don\u2019t proceed to the next item until you conquer the one you\u2019re working on. Although using relaxation procedures with initial exposure attempts is a good idea, you shouldn\u2019t use relaxation with exposure and response prevention for OCD as you proceed further."}, {"text": " That\u2019s because one of the crucial lessons is that your anxiety will come down if and only if you give exposure enough time. Furthermore, some people with OCD actually start to use relaxation as a compulsive ritual itself.

Finally, Cindy manages to touch it and stay with it. However, it takes a total of three hours of repeatedly attempting to touch and finally touching the litter box numerous times for as long as ten minutes each time for her anxiety to come down by half."}, {"text": " Sometimes exposure and response prevention takes a while, so set plenty of time aside. In Cindy\u2019s case, the final two items didn\u2019t require as much effort because her earlier work had seemingly cracked the compulsion enough so that it lost some of its power over her.  Upping the ante After she gets through her staircase of fear, Cindy takes one more initiative."}, {"text": " She tackles the toughest steps again.

Furthermore, if you stop taking them, your anxiety almost always returns."}, {"text": " Rebound anxiety that\u2019s more severe than that experienced before taking the drug is possible upon withdrawal. Benzodiazepines are also associated with increasing the risk of falling among the elderly. And falls among the elderly too often result in hip fractures. In addition, a recent report suggested that benzodiazepines may double the risk of getting into a motor vehicle accident."}, {"text": " That risk rapidly escalates when benzodiazepines are taken in combination with alcohol. In fact, benzodiazepines are particularly problematic for those who have a history of substance abuse. Those who are addicted to recreational drugs or alcohol readily become addicted to these medications and are at greater risk for combining alcohol with their medication."}, {"text": " Prescribing benzodiazepines to those who have suffered a recent trauma seems logical and humane. And indeed, these medications have the potential to improve sleep and reduce both arousal and anxiety. However, one study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology found that the early and prolonged administration of benzodiazepines after a trauma actually appeared to increase the rate of full-blown post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) later."}, {"text": " (See Chapter 2 for more information about PTSD.)  14_574416-ch09.indd 153  3/22/10 9:51 PM  \f154  Part II: Battling Anxiety It also seems logical to assume that combining benzodiazepines with some of the various changes in behavior or thinking that can reduce anxiety (see Chapters 5, 6, 7, and 8) would make for a useful combination that could yield a better outcome than using either approach by itself."}, {"text": " Yet studies conducted by psychologist Dr. Michael Otto at Massachusetts General Hospital have found that the risk of relapse is increased when these medications are combined with changes in thinking and behaving. In the long run, it appears that for most people, learning coping strategies to deal with their anxiety seems better than merely seeking pharmacological solutions \u2014 especially with respect to the benzodiazepines."}, {"text": " Nevertheless, the benzodiazepines remain one of the most popular approaches to the treatment of anxiety disorders, especially among general practitioners who have no special training in psychiatry. In part, that may be due to the low side effect profile of the drugs. And these medications can sometimes play an important role, especially for short-term, acute stress and anxiety, as well as for those for whom other medications haven\u2019t helped."}, {"text": " We simply urge considerable caution with the use of these agents. Following are some of the most commonly prescribed benzodiazepines listed by trade name, with generic names in parentheses: \u2713 Ativan (lorazepam) \u2713 Centrax (prazepam) \u2713 Klonopin (clonazepam) \u2713 Librium (chlordiazepoxide) \u2713 Serax (oxazepam) \u2713 Valium (diazepam) \u2713 Xanax (alprazolam)  Miscellaneous tranquilizers A few miscellaneous tranquilizers are chemically unrelated to the benzodiazepines and thus appear to work rather differently."}, {"text": " You should know that in addition to the following list of miscellaneous tranquilizers, other types of tranquilizers are available. Furthermore, exciting new types of anti-anxiety drugs are under development, and some are undergoing clinical trials. Some of these are fast-acting, yet may have less of the undesirable side effect of addiction that has been found with the benzodiazepines."}, {"text": " For the time being, we list two anti-anxiety medications (with their generic names in parentheses) that your doctor might prescribe:  14_574416-ch09.indd 154  3/22/10 9:51 PM  \fChapter 9: Considering Medications and Other Physical Treatment Options  155  \u2713 Buspar (buspirone): This medication belongs to a class of chemical compounds referred to as azaspirodecanediones (which are actually far less intimidating than their name)."}, {"text": " Exactly how buspar works is unknown. It has been studied the most for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), but may have value for treating various other anxiety-related problems, such as social phobia and PTSD, among others. It may not be as useful for panic attacks as other medications."}, {"text": " Although extensive evidence is necessary to rule out addictive potential, the current belief is that Buspar\u2019s likelihood for producing dependence is quite low. \u2713 Vistaril, also marketed as Atarax and Rezine (hydroxyzine): This medication is an antihistamine as well as a tranquilizer. It\u2019s used to treat various kinds of anxiety and tension-related problems as well as allergic reactions, such as hives and itching."}, {"text": " Fast-acting, this drug takes effect within 30 minutes.  Beta blockers Because anxiety can increase blood pressure, perhaps it\u2019s not surprising that a few medications for the treatment of hypertension also reduce anxiety. Chief among these are the so-called beta blockers that block the effects of norepinephrine."}, {"text": " Thus, they control many of the physical symptoms of anxiety, such as shaking, trembling, rapid heartbeat, and blushing. In the treatment of anxiety, their usefulness is primarily limited to specific phobias, such as social anxiety and performance anxiety. They\u2019re highly popular among professional musicians, who often use them to reduce their performance anxiety prior to an important concert or audition."}, {"text": " Two beta blockers, Inderal and Tenormin, are most frequently prescribed for these purposes: \u2713 Inderal (propranolol): Generally, Inderal is used for the short-term alleviation of stage fright, public speaking, test anxiety, and social anxiety. It\u2019s often given as a single dose prior to a performance."}, {"text": " \u2713 Tenormin (atenolol): This medication usually has fewer side effects than Inderal and is longer-acting. Tenormin is also often given as a single dose prior to a performance.  Atypical antipsychotics Medications called atypical antipsychotic medications are not often prescribed for anxiety disorders."}, {"text": " They\u2019re atypical in the sense that, unlike earlier medications, they have a lower risk of certain serious side effects, and they can be  14_574416-ch09.indd 155  3/22/10 9:51 PM  \f156  Part II: Battling Anxiety used to treat a far broader range of problems than simply psychosis, a disturbance in the ability to perceive reality correctly."}, {"text": " The atypical antipsychotics target a different neurotransmitter than the SSRIs and sometimes are used in combination with SSRIs. When used to treat anxiety-related problems, these medications are usually prescribed at far lower doses than when used for psychotic disorders. Upon seeing this category, you may have easily thought, \u201cHey, I\u2019m anxious; I\u2019m not crazy!\u201d And, in fact, psychosis is a serious mental disorder that often involves disordered thinking, hallucinations, delusions, and other serious distortions of reality."}, {"text": " So you may wonder why medications designed to treat psychosis have anything to do with treating anxiety. Those who merely suffer from anxiety rarely, if ever, experience the kind of substantially confused thinking that psychotics do. These medications are primarily prescribed for people who have severe, hard-to-treat anxiety or who suffer from other mental disorders along with anxiety."}, {"text": " They\u2019re generally not prescribed unless other forms of treatment have been unsuccessful. They have some especially distressing side effects. Possibly the most feared are known as extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), which can include a wide range of problems, such as \u2713 Abnormal, uncontrollable, irregular muscle movements in the face, mouth, and, sometimes, other body parts \u2713 An intense feeling of restlessness \u2713 Muscle stiffness \u2713 Prolonged spasms or muscle contractions \u2713 Shuffling gait These EPS effects appear to occur less often with the newer atypical antipsychotic medications as opposed to the older, traditional antipsychotic medications."}, {"text": " Because the risk of EPS is relatively low, those with severe anxiety disorders for whom changes in behavior or thinking (see Chapters 5, 6, 7, and 8) or other medications haven\u2019t helped sufficiently may want to consider using these new anti-anxiety tools. However, because the risk exists, those with relatively milder anxiety problems would probably want to avoid them."}, {"text": " Another disturbing side effect with many of these atypical antipsychotics is a change in metabolism that increases the risk of weight gain and can eventually lead to diabetes. As with most of the medications for anxiety, these should generally be avoided when pregnant or breast-feeding. Consult your physician for the best alternatives."}, {"text": "  14_574416-ch09.indd 156  3/22/10 9:51 PM  \fChapter 9: Considering Medications and Other Physical Treatment Options  157  Here are four antipsychotic medications, with their generic names in parentheses. Other medications are under development. \u2713 Risperdal (risperidone) \u2713 Abilify (aripiprazole) \u2713 Zyprexa (olanzapine) \u2713 Seroquel (quetiapine) \u2713 Geodon (ziprasivone)  Mood stabilizers Mood stabilizers are usually prescribed for other conditions."}, {"text": " However, when standard treatments haven\u2019t worked, doctors sometimes find them useful for treating their patients\u2019 anxiety.

Medications in this category include Depakote (valporic acid), Eskalith (lithium), Lamictal (lamotrigine), Neurontin (gabapentin), Tegretol (carbamazepine), and Topamax (topiramate)."}, {"text": "  A few intriguing medication options The search for anti-anxiety medication options leads to a few unexpected places. The following list describes a few of these. \u2713 Catapres (clonidine) is a medication usually used to treat hypertension by relaxing the blood vessels. It seems to ease some symptoms of PTSD, especially in children."}, {"text": " Serious side effects have been reported, however. \u2713 D-cycloserine, an antibiotic used as a treatment for chronic tuberculosis, appears to also help people extinguish their fears more quickly and completely when they\u2019re doing exposure types of therapy (see Chapter 8). Taking this drug while facing fears may allow people to speed up the process of unlearning the original fear, and the patient only needs to take the drug during a few therapy sessions."}, {"text": " \u2713 Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), also known as the street drug Ecstasy, has been found to facilitate exposure treatment for people with PTSD. The studies are promising but preliminary. Ecstasy appears to have a positive effect on mood and empathy. During therapy, it is administered under medical supervision \u2014 we don\u2019t encourage our readers to try this at home."}, {"text": "  14_574416-ch09.indd 157  3/22/10 9:51 PM  \f158  Part II: Battling Anxiety \u2713 Oxytocin is another interesting treatment for social phobia that is administered just before the client begins a session of cognitive behavioral therapy. Oxytocin, a naturally occurring hormone that is released by both men and women during orgasm, is given via nasal spray."}, {"text": " Oxytocin won\u2019t give you an orgasm administered this way, but researchers at the University of Zurich in Switzerland have found that people with social phobia who are given a few sniffs of oxytocin feel more confident and open to therapy.  Searching for Supplements Dietary supplements include vitamins, amino acids, minerals, enzymes, metabolites, or botanicals that reputedly enhance your health and/or your body\u2019s functions."}, {"text": " Such supplements appear in many different forms \u2014 capsules, powders, tablets, teas, liquids, and granules. You can buy supplements from the Internet, your local drugstore, a grocery store, or a health food store. Claimed benefits of supplements include improved immune systems, enhanced sleep, stronger bones, revved-up sexual response, cancer cures, and overcoming anxiety."}, {"text": " People seek supplements often because they assume that they\u2019re safer than prescription drugs. That\u2019s not necessarily true. Supplements are not considered drugs in the United States and therefore are not subjected to the same level of scrutiny as most medications. Before a prescription drug can come to market, the manufacturer must conduct clinical studies to establish the safety, effectiveness, dosage, and possible harmful interactions with other medications."}, {"text": " The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn\u2019t require clinical trials to establish the safety of herbs. Instead, after a supplement makes it to market, the only way it will be removed is if enough consumers suffer serious side effects and complain to the right agencies, which can trigger an FDA investigation and possible decision to withdraw the herb from store shelves."}, {"text": " Another serious problem with supplements is that untrained salespeople often make recommendations for their use. Fortunately, healthcare professionals who are also interested and trained in the safe and effective use of supplements can help. By contrast, salesclerks vary widely in the usefulness of their advice."}, {"text": " Dolores\u2019 story isn\u2019t all that unusual. A young, fit salesperson smiles at Dolores as she enters the health food store. Dolores tells him that she would like to find a natural remedy to help her calm down.

The relaxation procedures we give you in this chapter fall into three major categories: breathing techniques, ways to relax the body, and a few sensory experiences."}, {"text": " Some of these can take a little longer at first to gain full mastery  17_574416-ch11.indd 181  3/22/10 9:52 PM  \f182  Part III: Letting Go of the Battle over, but they can all be done in five minutes when you get the hang of them. The key is daily practice. Like every other skill, the more you do it, the easier and faster it gets."}, {"text": "  Blowing Anxiety Away You\u2019ve practiced breathing more than anything else in your life. In waking moments, you don\u2019t even think about breathing. Yet, of all biological functions, breathing is critical to life. You can go days or weeks without food and a couple of days without water but only minutes without breathing."}, {"text": " You need oxygen to purify the bloodstream, burn up waste products, and rejuvenate the body and mind. If you don\u2019t get enough oxygen, your thinking becomes sluggish, your blood pressure rises, and your heart rate increases. You also get dizzy, shaky, and depressed, and eventually you lose consciousness and die."}, {"text": " Many people react to stress with rapid, shallow breathing that throws off the desired ratio of oxygen to carbon dioxide in the blood. This phenomenon is called hyperventilation, and it causes a variety of distressing symptoms: \u2713 Blurred vision \u2713 Disorientation \u2713 Jitteriness \u2713 Loss of consciousness \u2713 Muscle cramps \u2713 Rapid pulse \u2713 Tingling sensations in the extremities or face  Anxiety and relaxation make for strange bedfellows Have you ever known two people who couldn\u2019t be in the same room at the same time? If they show up at the same party, trouble is bound to brew."}, {"text": " They\u2019re like oil and water \u2014 they just don\u2019t mix. Anxiety and relaxation are a little like that. Think about it. How can you be anxious at the same time that you\u2019re relaxed? Not an easy  17_574416-ch11.indd 182  accomplishment. Psychologists have a term for this phenomenon: reciprocal inhibition."}, {"text": " Many psychologists believe that the techniques described in this chapter work because relaxation inhibits anxiety, and vice versa. Training yourself diligently in the use of relaxation skills should help you inhibit your anxiety.  3/22/10 9:52 PM  \fChapter 11: Relaxation: The Five-Minute Solution  183  Hyperventilation frequently accompanies panic attacks as well as chronic anxiety."}, {"text": " The symptoms of over-breathing feel like symptoms of anxiety, and people with anxiety disorders may hyperventilate. Therefore, finding out how to breathe properly is considered an effective tool for managing anxiety.  Discovering your natural breathing pattern When you came into the world, unless you had a physical problem with your lungs, you probably breathed just fine."}, {"text": " Look at most babies. Unless they\u2019re in distress from hunger or pain, they need no instruction in how to breathe or relax. Their little tummies rise and fall with each breath in a rhythmic, natural way. The stresses of everyday life, however, have since meddled with your inborn, natural breathing response."}, {"text": " Under stress, people usually breathe shallow and fast, or, sometimes, they don\u2019t breathe at all. Some people hold their breath when they feel stressed and aren\u2019t even aware that they\u2019re doing it. Try noticing your breathing when you feel stressed, and see whether you\u2019re a breath-holder or a rapid, shallow breather."}, {"text": " You can also check out how you breathe when you\u2019re not stressed: 1. Lie down on your back. 2. Put one hand on your stomach and the other on your chest. 3. Notice the movements of your hands as you breathe. If you\u2019re breathing correctly, the hand on your stomach rises as you inhale and lowers as you exhale."}, {"text": " The hand on your chest doesn\u2019t move so much, and to the extent that it does, it should do so in tandem with the other hand. The odds are that if you have a problem with anxiety, your breathing could use a tuneup. That\u2019s especially so if you have trouble with panic attacks. Breathing practice can start you on the way to feeling calmer."}, {"text": "  Breathing like a baby Abdominal breathing involves breathing with your diaphragm \u2014 the muscle that lies between your abdominal cavity and your lung cavity. Try this exercise to start breathing slowly and deeply, like a baby again. You may want to lie down, or you can do this while sitting as long as you have a large, comfortable chair that you can stretch out in."}, {"text": " Follow these steps: 1. Check out your body for tension. Notice whether certain muscles feel tight, your breathing is shallow and rapid, you\u2019re clenching your teeth, or you have other distressing feelings.  17_574416-ch11.indd 183  3/22/10 9:52 PM  \f184  Part III: Letting Go of the Battle Rate your tension on a 1-to-10-point scale, with 1 representing complete relaxation and 10 meaning total tension."}, {"text": " 2.

Check to see that your hand rises from your abdomen."}, {"text": " Your chest should move only slightly and in tandem with your stomach. 8. Pause and hold your breath briefly. 9. Exhale as you did in Step 5, to a slow count of six. 10. Continue breathing in and out in this fashion for five minutes. 11. Check out your body again for tension, and rate that tension on a scale of 1 to 10."}, {"text": " We recommend that you do this abdominal breathing exercise at least once a day for five minutes, ten days in a row. For that matter, it isn\u2019t difficult to do this four or five times each day \u2014 your gains will pile up more quickly. You can do this breathing just about anywhere, anytime. You\u2019ll find it relaxing, and it won\u2019t add stress to your day by taking away valuable time."}, {"text": " After you do that, try noticing your breathing at various times during your regular routine. You\u2019ll quickly see whether you\u2019re breathing through the diaphragm or the upper chest like so many people do. Allow your diaphragm to take charge of your breathing. Slowly but surely, abdominal breathing can become a new habit that decreases your stress."}, {"text": " Consider keeping a record of your tension levels before and after this exercise. Over time you\u2019re likely to see concrete evidence that it works. Whenever you feel anxiety or panic coming on, try using abdominal breathing. You may head it off at the pass. On the other hand, anxiety, and especially panic, may rise to a level that makes these exercises more difficult."}, {"text": " If that happens to you, try the panic-breathing technique that we explain in the next section.  17_574416-ch11.indd 184  3/22/10 9:52 PM  \fChapter 11: Relaxation: The Five-Minute Solution  185  The benefits of controlled breathing Just in case you think that breathing better sounds like a rather unimaginative, simple way of reducing anxiety, you may want to consider its healthy effects."}, {"text": " Studies show that training in breathing can contribute to the reduction of panic attacks within a matter of a few weeks. Other studies have indicated that controlled breathing can slightly reduce blood pressure,  improve the heart\u2019s rhythm, reduce certain types of epileptic seizures, sharpen mental performance, increase blood circulation, quell worry, and possibly even improve the outcome of cardiac rehabilitation efforts following a heart attack."}, {"text": " Not a bad list of benefits for such a simple skill.  Using panic breathing in high-stress situations Now and then, you need a faster, more powerful technique to relax. Perhaps you went to the mall and felt trapped, or maybe you were on your way to a job interview and felt overwhelmed. Whatever the situation, when stress hits you unexpectedly, try our panic-breathing technique: 1."}, {"text": " Inhale deeply and slowly through your nose. 2. Hold your breath for a slow count of six. 3. Slowly breathe out through your lips to a count of eight, making a slight hissing sound as you do. That sound can be so soft that only you can hear it. You don\u2019t have to worry about anyone around you thinking that you\u2019re crazy."}, {"text": " 4. Repeat this type of breath five or ten times. You may think that panic breathing is difficult to do when stress strikes suddenly. We won\u2019t deny it takes some practice. The key is the slight hissing sound, which gives you a much easier way to slow down your breath. If panic breathing doesn\u2019t help, and you feel like you may be having a fullblown panic attack that won\u2019t go away, try breathing in and out of a paper bag with the opening wrapped around your mouth."}, {"text": " Breathing this way rebalances the ratio of oxygen to carbon dioxide and should cut the panic attack short. When you breathe too rapidly, your body accumulates an excess of oxygen, although it feels like you have too little of it. Breathing in the bag brings the level of carbon dioxide up to normal."}, {"text": " Don\u2019t start carrying a paper bag with you everywhere you go. You need to learn to cope with the fact that sometimes, panic attacks just happen and that you\u2019ll live through them if they do.  17_574416-ch11.indd 185  3/22/10 9:52 PM  \f186  Part III: Letting Go of the Battle  Relaxing Your Whole Body Some of you may find that breathing techniques quell your anxiety quickly."}, {"text": " Others may require a technique that directly aims at total body relaxation. Relaxing your body takes some time and practice, but it\u2019s worth it. Over a half century ago, Dr. Edmund Jacobsen, a Chicago physician, developed what has come to be the most widely used relaxation technique in the United States, progressive muscle relaxation."}, {"text": " You can find a wide variety of similar techniques, all described as progressive muscle relaxation, in various books and journals. Each of them may use different muscle groups or proceed in a different order, but they all do essentially the same thing. Progressive muscle relaxation involves going through various muscle groups in the body and tensing each one for a little while, followed by a quick letting go of the tension."}, {"text": " You then attend to the sensation of release, noticing how the limp muscles feel in contrast to their previous tense state.  Knowing what to expect You\u2019ll find it useful to look for the right place to do your progressive muscle relaxation. You probably don\u2019t have a soundproof room, but find the quietest place that you can."}, {"text": " Consider turning the phones to silent mode. Choose some comfortable clothing, or at least loosen any clothing you\u2019re wearing that\u2019s tight and constricting. You don\u2019t need shoes, belts, or anything uncomfortable. Realize that when you begin tensing each muscle group, you shouldn\u2019t overexert; don\u2019t tighten using more than about two-thirds of all your effort."}, {"text": " When you tense, hold it for six to ten seconds and notice how the tension feels. Then let go of the tension all at the same time, as though a string holding the muscle up were cut loose. After you release the muscle, focus on the relaxed feeling and allow it to deepen for 10 or 15 seconds. If you don\u2019t achieve a desired state of relaxation for that muscle group, you can do the procedure one or two more times if you want."}, {"text": " You should know that you can\u2019t make relaxation happen. You allow it to happen. Perfectionists struggle with this idea. Don\u2019t force it, and rid your mind of the idea that you must do this exercise perfectly. When you tighten one muscle group, try to keep all the other muscles in your body relaxed."}, {"text": " Doing this takes a little practice, but you can figure out how to tense one body area at a time. Keep your face especially relaxed when you\u2019re tensing any area other than your face. Yoga instructors often say, \u201cSoften your eyes.\u201d We\u2019re not exactly sure what that means, but it seems to help."}, {"text": "  17_574416-ch11.indd 186  3/22/10 9:52 PM  \fChapter 11: Relaxation: The Five-Minute Solution  187  Occasionally, relaxation training makes people feel surprisingly uncomfortable. If this happens to you, stop. If it continues to occur with repeated practice, you may want to seek professional help. Also, don\u2019t tighten any body part that hurts."}, {"text": " Avoid tightening any area that has suffered injury or has given you trouble, such as a lower back.  Discovering the progressive muscle technique After you\u2019ve read through the tips in the preceding section, you\u2019re ready to start. Sit down in your chosen place and get comfortable. 1. Take a deep breath, hold, imagine, and let the tension go."}, {"text": " Pulling the air into your abdomen, breathe deeply. Hold your breath for three or four seconds, and then slowly let the air out. Imagine your whole body is a balloon losing air as you exhale, and let tension go out with the air. Take three more such breaths and feel your entire body getting more limp with each one."}, {"text": " 2. Squeeze your hands tight and then relax. Squeeze your fingers into a fist. Feel the tension and hold it for six to ten seconds. Then, all at once, release your hands and let them go limp. Allow the tension in your hands to flow out. Let the relaxation deepen for 10 to 15 seconds. 3. Tighten your arms and then relax."}, {"text": " Bring your lower arms up almost to your shoulders and tighten the muscles. Make sure you tense the muscles on the inside and outside of both the upper and lower arms. If you\u2019re not sure you\u2019re doing that, use one hand to do a tension check on the other arm. Hold the tension a little while, and then drop your arms as though you cut a string holding them up."}, {"text": " Let the tension flow out and the relaxation flow in. 4. Raise up your shoulders, tighten, and then relax. Raise your shoulders up as though you were a turtle trying to get into its shell. Hold the tension and then let your shoulders drop. Feel the relaxation deepen for 10 to 15 seconds. 5. Tighten and relax the muscles in your upper back."}, {"text": " Pull your shoulders back and bring your shoulder blades closer together. Hold that tension a little while . . . then let it go. 6. Scrunch up your entire face, and then relax. Squeeze your forehead down, bring your jaws together, tighten your eyes and eyebrows, and contract your tongue and lips.

Tighten these muscles by arching your lower back, pressing it back against the chair, or tensing the muscles any way you want."}, {"text": " Gently increase and maintain the tension, but don\u2019t overdo it. Now, relax and allow the waves to roll in. 11. Contract and relax your buttocks muscles. Tighten your buttocks so as to gently lift yourself up in your chair. Hold the tension. Then let the tension melt and the relaxation grow. 12. Squeeze and relax your thigh muscles."}, {"text": " Tighten and hold these muscles. Then relax and feel the tension draining out; let the calm deepen and spread. 13. Contract and relax your calves. Tighten the muscles in your calves by pulling your toes toward your face.

Gently curl your toes, maintain the tension, and then relax. 15. Take a little time to tour your entire body. Notice whether you feel better than when you began. If you find areas of tension, allow the relaxed areas around them to come in and replace them."}, {"text": " If that doesn\u2019t work, repeat the procedure for the tense area. 16. Spend a few minutes enjoying the relaxed feelings. Let relaxation spread and penetrate every muscle fiber in your body. Notice any sensations you have. Whatever you feel, allow it to happen. When you\u2019re ready, you can open your eyes and go on with your day, perhaps feeling like you just returned from a brief vacation."}, {"text": " Some people like to make a recording of the progressive muscle relaxation instructions to facilitate their efforts.

Well, for starters, progressive relaxation training is usually a component of most successful treatment programs for anxiety. However, studies also show that progressive muscle relaxation can effectively reduce various types of chronic pain, such as the pain associated with ulcerative colitis, cancer, and headaches."}, {"text": " It also works to reduce insomnia. A  study published in the December 2001 issue of the Journal of Clinical Psychology found that in addition to inducing greater relaxation, progressive muscle relaxation also led to increased mental quiet and joy. Other studies have suggested that it may improve the functioning of your immune system."}, {"text": " We aren\u2019t suggesting that progressive muscle relaxation cures cancer, and it won\u2019t whisk away all your pain or eradicate all your anxiety. However, many studies clearly show that it exerts benefits across a surprisingly wide range of problems. We recommend that you give it a try.  In the beginning, take a little longer than five minutes to go through the steps of progressive muscle relaxation."}, {"text": " Taking 20 or 30 minutes several times at first usually works better. However, the more you practice, the more quickly you\u2019ll find that you can slide into serenity. Shorten the procedure as you progress. For example, you can tense all the muscles in your lower body at once, followed by all your upper body muscles."}, {"text": " At other times, you may want to simply tense and relax a few body areas that carry most of your tension. Most often, that involves the neck, shoulder, and back muscles. Some folks discover that they can relax in a single minute after they become proficient.  Applying Relaxation in Tense Situations Discovering how to relax using breathing techniques or progressive muscle relaxation may help you reduce your anxiety."}, {"text": " But if you just do these activities when you\u2019re lying around in bed or spending a quiet day at home, you miss the opportunity to challenge your fears with a powerful tool. Applied relaxation means taking the techniques that you\u2019ve practiced and putting them to work when you\u2019re under the most stress."}, {"text": " The key to success lies in the mastery of the technique in nonstressful settings before taking the next step. For example, maybe you\u2019ve practiced the progressive relaxation technique many times, and you can tighten and loosen your muscles, achieving a state of relaxation in just a few minutes.  17_574416-ch11."}, {"text": "indd 189  3/22/10 9:52 PM  \f190  Part III: Letting Go of the Battle Now that you\u2019ve mastered the technique in a nonstressful setting, think of a particular situation that frightens you, such as public speaking. For example, say you\u2019ve scheduled a speaking engagement for a large event with an audience of several hundred people."}, {"text": " Before your speech, you practice your favorite relaxation technique. You try to maintain that state as you walk up to give your speech, but you panic anyway. What happened? You tried to take on too much all at once. Applied relaxation works best if you break the tasks into more manageable steps. For example, you could practice relaxation while thinking about giving your talk."}, {"text": " Then you could practice relaxation just before giving your talk to a small audience rather than a large group.

We can\u2019t possibly know which direction will work best for you."}, {"text": " You have to experiment with various approaches to discover your own relaxation remedy. In this section, we ask that you allow your senses to soothe you.  Sounds to soothe the savage beast Ever since people have populated the planet, they\u2019ve turned to music for comfort. From primitive drums to symphony orchestras, sound elicits emotions \u2014 love, excitement, fear \u2014 and even relaxation."}, {"text": " An entire profession of music therapists has capitalized on the power of music. Music therapists work in hospitals, schools, and nursing homes using sounds to soothe. But you don\u2019t need to be a music therapist to make use of music\u2019s power. You probably already know what type of music calms you."}, {"text": " Perhaps you love classical music or jazz. You may not have thought of trying out a CD of ocean waves, babbling brooks, whispering wind, or other sounds of nature. Many people find those sounds quite relaxing. Visit any well-supplied music store or Web site and you\u2019ll find an extensive array of possibilities."}, {"text": " Experiment with new sounds. Many of these recordings boast of containing specially mixed music for optimal relaxation. Buyer beware! Don\u2019t buy just any recording that promises relaxation.

Perhaps it takes you back to Sunday mornings when your mother baked fresh rolls or to a pleasant caf\u00e9. If so, the aroma automatically brings back memories \u2014 no effort required on your part. A huge perfume industry uses the power of aromas to attract and seduce."}, {"text": " Manufacturers of deodorants, lotions, powders, hair sprays, and air fresheners do the same, and you can explore the ability of aroma to calm your jangled nerves. Aromatherapy makes use of essential oils, which are natural substances extracted from plants. These substances ostensibly affect both physical and emotional health."}, {"text": " We can\u2019t vouch for these claims, because good studies on their effects are lacking. However, the theory behind aromatherapy isn\u2019t entirely wacky, because our bodies have nerves that transmit messages from the nose into the parts of the brain that control mood, memories, and appetite.

In years past, only the elite sought massage therapy. Today, people flock to massage therapists to reduce stress, to manage pain, and to just plain feel good. Another way of getting a massage is to sit in a whirlpool for five minutes."}, {"text": " This can be relaxing because, in addition to the massage that you get from the force of the water jets, the feel of the warm water that\u2019s forced into the whirlpool and the sound of the water rushing around also has a calming effect.

A shocking number of these orphans failed to grow or interact with others, and some appeared to wilt away and die for no discernible reason. They had sufficient food, clothing, and shelter.

Looking at the likelihood of dying from a natural disaster You\u2019ve certainly heard the eternal question about when a tree falls in a forest \u2014 if no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound? Natural disasters are sort of like that tree."}, {"text": " Are calamitous events truly calamitous if no one is around when they occur? Maybe not. However, plenty of disasters hurt people \u2014 often in significant numbers \u2014 when they occur. Disasters can also lead to financial, environmental, and emotional distress or loss. The following list represents some of the most common natural disasters that people worry about: \u2713 Avalanches are sudden snow slides that break loose and pummel or bury anything in their path."}, {"text": " They kill about 150 people per year. Most avalanches occur after a winter storm. The risk of dying in an avalanche can be put in perspective by knowing that the world population now stands at about 6.8 billion and counting. \u2713 Earthquakes occur thousands of times every day. The vast majority of these quakes are minor and unnoticeable on the earth\u2019s surface."}, {"text": " From time to time, however, earthquakes unleash a powerful explosion of pent-up energy sending huge, destructive seismic waves across a broad area. On average, about 10,000 people die in earthquakes each year. Most die in collapsed buildings, but earthquake-triggered landslides, fires, and floods also claim lives."}, {"text": " \u2713 Fires, whether in forests, houses, or buildings, kill more people than most natural disasters. The U.S. Fire Administration claims that the United States\u2019 rate of fire deaths is among the highest in the industrialized world. Nonetheless, the risk of dying from fire in the United States is somewhere around 15 in one million."}, {"text": " \u2713 Floods occur when large volumes of water submerge land, houses, buildings, and people. They often result from extreme weather such as hurricanes or torrential downpours. Floods also occur when dams and other barriers break.

However, floods sometimes kill more than 100,000 people in a single incident."}, {"text": " And many more people lose their possessions and property to floods. \u2713 Hurricanes emerge from some tropical storms and generate wind speeds of 75 to over 150 miles an hour. Most of those who die from hurricanes die from flooding (see the preceding item in this list). Have we got you worried? Consider that this list pales in comparison to all the possible natural disasters."}, {"text": " Perhaps you can\u2019t readily think of other disasters, but Wikipedia lists these (among others!): \u2713 Asteroids \u2713 Blizzards & extreme cold \u2713 Falling junk from outer space \u2713 Gamma ray bursts (massive electromagnetic explosions in galaxies that have even been speculated as having the potential to someday cause mass extinctions on earth!) \u2713 Hailstorms \u2713 Heat waves \u2713 Lightning \u2713 Limnic eruptions (a huge eruption of carbon dioxide from deep lakes that can suffocate livestock and people in the area) \u2713 Tornados \u2713 Tsunamis \u2713 Volcanic eruptions You get the idea."}, {"text": " Possibilities abound. But your overall risk of death from any particular natural disaster is far lower than death by your own hand or accidental death \u2014 both of which most people worry much less about than natural disasters.

Tabulating your personal risks The lists in the preceding section include the most common natural disasters (and obviously a number that aren\u2019t so common).

For example, people who live in certain areas of California choose the wonderful weather over the risk of living in earthquake, fire, and mudslide risk zones."}, {"text": " And if you go helicopter skiing frequently, you darn well better know about what triggers avalanches. So a given individual may have a much greater risk of being harmed or killed by natural disasters than the average person. If that risk applies to you, you want to take extra precautions.

In Chapter 5, we provide a list of five questions for helping you deal with some pretty difficult worst-case scenarios."}, {"text": " We suggest answering these questions for your fears of natural disasters. First, we show you the questions, and then we illustrate their use with an example. \u2713 Have I ever dealt with anything like this in the past? \u2713 How much will this affect my life a year from now? \u2713 Do I know people who\u2019ve coped with something like this, and how did they do it? \u2713 Do I know anyone I could turn to for help or support? \u2713 Can I think of a creative new possibility that could result from this challenge?

I guess about 36 million or so Californians have lived through a few earthquakes and haven\u2019t moved out."}, {"text": " They must have accepted the risk and learned to live with it.

At first, the strategy sounds to Alejandro like the psychologist is recommending that he do more of what\u2019s already scaring him \u2014 imagining scenes of horror and destruction. But the psychologist explains that imaginal exposure is different in a crucial manner."}, {"text": " Imaginal exposure asks you to break your fears down into steps and gradually confront each one in your mind. He tells Alejandro that he will hold the image of each step in his mind until his anxiety reduces by up to 50 percent. They start with the easiest step and work up from there. Figure 15-1 shows what his staircase of fear looks like:  Imagining being crushed to death by a falling building (99) Imagining huddling in a doorway as the building sways wildly and walls start to crumble (90) Imagining bookcases falling (85) Imagining dishes crashing from the cabinets (80) Imagining the pictures falling off the walls (75) Imagining lying in bed while feeling the \ufb02oor start to sway (70) Figure 15-1: Alejandro\u2019s imaginal staircase of fear."}, {"text": "  Watching a movie about earthquakes (60) Writing a story about an earthquake (55) Talking to my psychologist about earthquakes (50) Talking to my psychologist about imaginal exposure (40)  Note that some of Alejandro\u2019s steps occur solely in his imagination, and a few involve taking direct actions."}, {"text": " By the time Alejandro has worked through his staircase of fear, his anxiety about earthquakes bothers him much less than it used to.  22_574416-ch15.indd 240  3/22/10 9:54 PM  \fChapter 15: Keeping Steady When the World Is Shaking  241  Doing Your Part to Improve the World A number of research studies have shown that when people take charge of challenges and do something active, they cope better than if they cope passively."}, {"text": " Passive copers usually do little more than try not to think about what worries them \u2014 this approach actually makes things worse for them. On the other hand, active copers look for direct actions they can take to make themselves feel empowered.

In other cases, you may discover that your skills don\u2019t fit well with the group. Or you may find that your own shyness inhibits your efforts at first.

They avoid crowded places. When venturing out, they wear surgical masks and carry disinfectants. Fear causes them to severely restrict their activities and interferes with their ability to enjoy life fully.

He begins to understand that he can\u2019t stay completely safe all the time."}, {"text": " And if he does get sick, it\u2019s likely that his illness can be treated. Furthermore, he sees that some of his perceived \u201cbenefits\u201d for his worry are illusions. Thus, he could eat healthy food, stay slim, and still get sick whether he worries or not. He decides to take a chance and eat at a vegetarian restaurant with his cousin."}, {"text": " If you worry about your health, take Arturo\u2019s approach.

Now, most industrialized countries boast a life expectancy well into the 70s."}, {"text": " People over 100 are the fastest-growing sector of the world population, with expectations that this segment will be over 6 million strong by mid-century. Today, heart diseases and cancer have replaced contagious diseases as the most likely cause of death. Yet, it seems that as people live longer, they don\u2019t appear to be living healthier."}, {"text": " The skyrocketing costs of healthcare not only reflect improvement in care but also the fact that many more people have chronic diseases. In the following sections, we take a look at when it makes sense to keep tabs on diseases and epidemics and when you can safely ignore them.  Examining the evolving realities of diseases and treatments Paradoxically, longer life spans and modern medicine give people more to worry about all the time."}, {"text": " Even though people live longer, in a sense, they\u2019re getting sicker. There are several reasons for this increase. First, more years of life equal more wear and tear on the body. Many diseases become more frequent with age, such as cancer, arthritis, dementia, and hormonal disorders, so obviously, in an aging population, the risk for getting sick is greater."}, {"text": " Second, so-called advances in technology and medicine allow doctors to find disorders they never looked for in the past, such as prostate cancer. Even though the vast majority of \u201csufferers\u201d have relatively few symptoms and eventually die of other causes, we now worry about such cancer and often experience significant side effects from the treatment itself."}, {"text": " Furthermore, we treat things we never used to see as problems. For example, what used to be considered normal aches and pains in the knee can now be seen on an MRI and diagnosed as osteoarthritis. Unfortunately, the surgical treatment of osteoarthritis has recently been found to be no better than a placebo \u2014 the treatment consisted of giving some patients a sham surgery (the patients thought they received surgery, but actually did not \u2014 the surgeons even cut open their knees and stitched them right back up)."}, {"text": "  23_574416-ch16.indd 247  3/22/10 9:55 PM  \f248  Part IV: Zeroing in on Specific Worries On the other hand, screening can prevent diseases from even occurring in the first place. For example, the dreaded colonoscopy can detect benign polyps before they become cancerous. Removing these polyps stops colon cancer before it has the chance to take hold."}, {"text": " That\u2019s wonderful. Yet another interesting cost of medical advancement is the additional risk that some treatments carry. For example, acid reflux disease used to be called indigestion. Known to increase the risk of certain cancers, it\u2019s now vigorously treated with medication to reduce or eliminate stomach acid."}, {"text": " However, stomach acid protects us against common bacteria such as salmonella. So people being treated for acid reflux may be at greater risk for food poisoning. Other medications such as antipsychotics (see Chapter 9) can help people with severe mental disorders but lead to weight gain and diabetes."}, {"text": " Another example can be found in the treatment of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is defined as significant loss of bone density that results in an increased risk of bone fractures. This disorder can be successfully treated with medication. However, a rare side effect of long-term use of these medications results in collapse of bones (the very problem the treatment is supposed to deter)."}, {"text": " Finally, definitions of disease have changed over time. Blood pressure is now considered high and treatable at lower levels than before; the cutoff for normal cholesterol has also dropped. The idea is to treat diseases early to prevent later problems. That can be a good idea, but what constitutes diseases sometimes gets out of hand, such as when normal sadness is defined as serious depression in need of medication."}, {"text": " Consider another example: Minor loss of bone density was once thought to be a common and normal result of aging. But today medical providers have started treating a \u201cnew\u201d condition called osteopenia \u2014 a milder loss of bone mass than osteoporosis. Treating this newly diagnosed \u201cdisease\u201d has led to a huge increase in sales of the drugs originally developed for osteoporosis."}, {"text": " Because this disorder is usually found among younger people, the long-term effects of treatment with medication are not yet known. Take the time to keep informed about the risks and benefits of treatments, and make modifications in your lifestyle as much as you can to stay healthy.  Weighing local versus global health risks People who worry about their health sometimes focus on potential threats that are quite rare."}, {"text": " Take some time and think about the risks of getting sick in your locality as compared to somewhere else in the world. For example, if  23_574416-ch16.indd 248  3/22/10 9:55 PM  \fChapter 16: Staying Healthy  249  you live in the United States or Canada, you\u2019re pretty unlikely to come down with malaria or typhoid fever."}, {"text": " And if you live in a country where adequate care is available, getting sick is not necessarily a death sentence.

So if you\u2019ve recently been a victim, you may be experiencing some serious signs of anxiety or distress. That reaction is pretty normal. And the first thing we\u2019re going to tell you is that, unless your symptoms are quite severe and interfering greatly with your life, don\u2019t seek out mental-health treatment right away! That\u2019s because, in many cases, your mind\u2019s own natural healing process will suffice."}, {"text": " Furthermore, it\u2019s quite easy to interfere with natural recovery. For example, a single debriefing session often takes place after exposure to a traumatic event. In such a session, people are given basic information about trauma and its potential effects and are then encouraged to talk about how they\u2019re coping with it."}, {"text": " But such a session may actually increase the risk of emotional symptoms occurring or continuing. If you\u2019re offered such a single-session intervention, we suggest skipping it unless it\u2019s obligatory. It\u2019s perfectly okay not to want to talk about the trauma right away. So here\u2019s what we recommend you do first if you\u2019re unfortunate enough to witness or experience a highly traumatic event: \u2713 Realize that it\u2019s normal to feel fearful and distressed."}, {"text": " \u2713 Talk to people you feel comfortable discussing the trauma with, but don\u2019t let yourself be pressured to talk by anyone. \u2713 Ask yourself what you\u2019ve done in the past to get through tough times, and see whether that helps you get through this one. For example, some people find benefit from spiritual counseling, prayer, turning to friends, or increasing exercise."}, {"text": " \u2713 If you\u2019re experiencing severe symptoms such as flashbacks, serious insomnia, significant irritability, or anxiety after a few months (even sooner if the symptoms are highly disturbing), consider seeing a mentalhealth professional for three or more sessions.

But with help, the misery and pain can decrease, and life satisfaction can get much better. Cognitive processing therapy (CPT) was developed by Patricia Resick and colleagues and has been shown to help some survivors get to a better place."}, {"text": " With this approach, you take a hard look back and write a statement about the meaning that the traumatic event had for you in your life. In other words, describe how you think your life has changed: \u2713 Do you feel responsible for the trauma? \u2713 Do you feel unsafe everywhere you go? \u2713 Have you changed the way you feel about yourself as a person? \u2713 Are you angry, sad, or ashamed? Your therapist will then help you explore your feelings and how your thoughts may be contributing to making things worse than they need to be for you."}, {"text": " Among other things, your therapist may ask you these questions: \u2713 How does this event affect the way you see yourself and the world? \u2713 What would you tell a friend that this event meant about him or her as a person? Can you accept saying the same thing to yourself? \u2713 Do you know anyone who has coped with something like this? If so, how did they do it? \u2713 Do you believe that you\u2019re more unsafe than anyone else? If so, what is the evidence that you are? \u2713 Did you want this traumatic event to happen to you? If not, can you stop blaming yourself? \u2713 Is there anything shameful about having been a victim of trauma or violence? \u2713 Can you think of a creative new possibility that could result from this challenge?

As you do, don\u2019t try to squelch your emotions; instead, let the feelings flow."}, {"text": " You can also embellish your story with more detail over time. Some professionals consider this written account and the reading of the traumatic event to be a form of exposure therapy. Preliminary evidence suggests that this part of CPT may work as well as exposure, which we discuss in the next section."}, {"text": " However, repeatedly reading your written account of the event may be somewhat less distressing than more direct exposure strategies.  Exposing yourself to the incident Exposure therapy, as we describe in Chapter 8, has been supported by more research studies than any other approach for treating PTSD."}, {"text": " Briefly, exposure therapy involves making extended contact with the traumatic event, usually through imagery. For example, a combat veteran may be asked to make an extensive list of all the details of his traumatic combat experiences. He would then be asked to list each detail and rate it for how much distress it causes him when he thinks about it."}, {"text": " The list is organized into a hierarchy, or what we call a staircase of fear. Starting with the least upsetting step, he would be asked to imagine it in detail until his anxiety and distress drop significantly. Then he would move on to the next step. See Chapter 8 for details and a specific example applied to PTSD."}, {"text": " The main problem with this approach lies in the fact that lots of trauma victims really don\u2019t want to revisit their trauma. Thus, the very idea of therapy elicits feelings of great distress. For some, exposure seems like adding more suffering to their already traumatized lives. For that reason, among others, far too many trauma victims fail to get treatment."}, {"text": " If you find that the prospect of exposure therapy seems completely overwhelming to you, consider seeking CPT first. Not every mental-health professional has been trained in both exposure therapy and CPT, so be sure to ask.  Accepting a Certain Degree of Uncertainty Emotional distress stemming from traumas and violence presents a challenge, yet it\u2019s quite normal."}, {"text": " It\u2019s important to realize that people can\u2019t control the emotions that arise from such causes.

And a good percentage of them end up with symptoms or a diagnosis of PTSD. Those who fully understand and accept both the risks of the job and the fact that they may experience emotional distress from exposure to trauma just may be a little less vulnerable to traumatic events than those who see themselves as invincible."}, {"text": " Paradoxically, the more you can accept whatever responses you have, the more easily you\u2019ll probably deal with them. However, those who view themselves as indestructible may actually choose to go into their fields with an inflated sense of invulnerability. These people are more likely to have emotional pain from their experiences and refuse or shun help."}, {"text": " They believe that part of their job is to handle whatever happens to them. Sadly, they\u2019re not immune to horror and trauma, yet they think that they should be. If you or someone you care about has a front-line position in a field like medical care, law enforcement, or the military, you\u2019re at risk, just like everyone else, for getting a stress disorder from exposure to horrible events."}, {"text": " This doesn\u2019t make you weak or less competent.

When help turns into harm People with anxiety desperately seek ways to alleviate their distress."}, {"text": " One common way is to ask for reassurance. If it\u2019s your partner who has anxiety, of course you want to help by giving that reassurance.

Unfortunately, reassuring your partner makes anxiety increase over time."}, {"text": " How can something designed to alleviate anxiety create more anxiety? Well, the immediate reduction in anxiety reinforces or rewards the act of seeking assistance.

Here are a few additional tips: \u2022 Before asking your loved one to carry out a step, see whether she wants you to model the task first.

However, we know that biological interventions (such as medications) affect serotonin levels, and it appears that behavioral strategies, such as those described in this book, also alter brain chemistry in productive ways.  Early mastery experiences When a hungry or uncomfortable baby cries out and parents respond by feeding or comforting, the baby experiences a beginning sense of mastery."}, {"text": " In other words, what the baby does results in a predictable outcome.

If parents respond unpredictably and chaotically to an infant\u2019s attempts to control his or her environment, anxiety is likely to increase."}, {"text": " So to decrease the probability of anxiety, responding predictably to young children is imperative. For young infants, parents should respond with reasonable consistency to most of their distress. Later, predictability is still important but should occur only to age-appropriate distress or requests."}, {"text": " In other words, you wouldn\u2019t want to reinforce a 2-year-old\u2019s temper tantrums by caving in.

Taking precautions via parenting style Parents can set children up to develop an anxiety disorder, or parents can help to prevent anxiety, depending on their parenting style:  28_574416-ch20.indd 290  3/22/10 9:57 PM  \fChapter 20: Helping Kids Conquer Anxiety  291  \u2713 Permissive parents engage with their kids and show concern and caring."}, {"text": " But permissive parents hate confrontation, and they abhor seeing their kids feel bad. Therefore, they set low expectations for their children, and they don\u2019t push them to act mature or try new things. \u2713 Authoritarian parents represent the opposite extreme. They demand, direct, and expect instant obedience from their children."}, {"text": " They control every detail of their children\u2019s lives and tend to be overly structured and hostile. \u2713 Authoritative parents take the middle road. These parents set reasonable limits and boundaries. They\u2019re flexible and aware of their kids\u2019 developmental stage. They try to help their kids understand the reasons behind their expectations for good behavior, although they don\u2019t spend a whole lot of time reasoning, or debating, with their kids."}, {"text": " Keep reading for more details about how each of these parenting styles affects a child\u2019s anxiety level.  Permissive and authoritarian parenting Both the permissive and the authoritarian types of parents fuel anxiety in children. The following story is about both types. The mother demonstrates permissive parenting, and the father is an authoritarian."}, {"text": " Four-year-old Nancy screams with terror. Her parents rush into her room to see what\u2019s wrong. \u201cThere\u2019s a bad man in my room; I saw him,\u201d she cries. Nancy\u2019s mother hugs her, strokes her hair, and tells her, \u201cEverything will be okay now that Mommy\u2019s here.\u201d Her dad turns on the light. He checks her closet and under her bed and snaps, \u201cThere\u2019s nobody here."}, {"text": " Just stay in your bed and go to sleep. Don\u2019t be such a baby.\u201d When this scene reenacts itself night after night for six weeks, Nancy\u2019s dad becomes increasingly annoyed and speaks harshly to her about what he calls her silly fears. At the same time, her mother overprotects Nancy. Her mom even starts to sleep in her room to make her feel safe."}, {"text": " Her fears only intensify. Poor Nancy receives mixed messages from her parents, and neither message helps.  Authoritative parenting A different kind of parenting can help your kids deal with anxiety better. It\u2019s called authoritative (as opposed to authoritarian) parenting. Authoritative parents provide clear expectations for their children."}, {"text": " They encourage their kids to face challenges. They validate their children\u2019s feelings of anxiety but urge them to deal with them. They aren\u2019t harsh or punitive, but they don\u2019t overprotect.

Occasionally, you may need to hang in there for an hour or two."}, {"text": " The first night is usually the worst. Don\u2019t give up. Eventually, the vast majority of kids start falling asleep sooner. If that doesn\u2019t happen after four or five nights in a row, you may need to consult a professional.  Helicopter parenting The term helicopter parenting has gained popularity in the past decade."}, {"text": " Think of a helicopter hovering over you, following you throughout each day as you go about your business. Specifically, these parents direct their kids\u2019 lives, run interference for them whenever they can, and try to shield them from all bad feelings. Thus, a helicopter parent will complain to teachers about grades or assignments, argue with coaches, and confront their children\u2019s peers when a conflict occurs."}, {"text": " It\u2019s bad enough when helicopter parents hover in this manner during elementary school. But some of these folks never stop. They continue to prevent their teens from experiencing the  28_574416-ch20.indd 292  consequences of their own behavior and misjudgments. Some of these parents even write their kids\u2019 college papers for them."}, {"text": " In fact, a few colleges have found that parental interest is so intense that parent-teacher associations (PTAs) have sprung up on campus. Helicopter parents often have high expectations of their kids, unlike permissive parents. However, they\u2019re similar to permissive parents in that they can\u2019t stand seeing their kids feel frustration or upset."}, {"text": " The problem with both types of parents is that they fail to teach their kids how to deal with life\u2019s difficulties. Anxiety often results.  3/22/10 9:57 PM  \fChapter 20: Helping Kids Conquer Anxiety  293  Helping Already Anxious Children If you have a child with anxiety, don\u2019t make yourself anxious by blaming yourself for the problem."}, {"text": " Multiple factors probably went into making your kid anxious (for more information, read Chapter 3).

That\u2019s because if you don\u2019t help yourself first, you won\u2019t be in any condition to help your child. The same principle applies to anxiety in your kids. You need to tackle your own anxiety prior to trying to help your children."}, {"text": " Children learn many of their emotional responses by observing their parents; it makes sense that anxious parents more often end up with anxious children. The nice part of getting rid of your own anxiety first is that this is likely to help your children, as well as give you the resources for assisting with their worries."}, {"text": " You can do this by reading this book for yourself. Pick and choose the strategies that best fit your problem and personality. However, if the ideas you choose first don\u2019t seem to work, don\u2019t despair. The vast majority of the time, one or more of the techniques that we describe does help. If you find that reading this book and trying our recommendations don\u2019t reduce your anxiety as much as you\u2019d like, consider consulting a mentalhealth professional who\u2019s trained in cognitive behavioral therapy."}, {"text": "  Modeling mellow If you don\u2019t have a problem with anxiety or if you\u2019ve overcome your excessive worries for the most part, you\u2019re ready to teach by example.

Whether the anxious person is a child or an adult, the strategy is much the same.

Then, consider using exposure, which involves breaking the feared situation or object into small steps. You gradually confront and stay with each step until anxiety reduces by 50 percent or more."}, {"text": " Read Chapter 8 for important, additional details about exposure. However, keep a few things in mind when doing this as a guide for your child: \u2713 Break the steps down as small as you possibly can. Don\u2019t expect your child to master a fear overnight. It takes time. And children need smaller steps than adults."}, {"text": " For example, if you\u2019re dealing with a fear of dogs, don\u2019t expect your child to immediately walk up to and pet a dog on the first attempt. Instead, start with pictures and storybooks about dogs. Then progress to seeing dogs at a distance, behind an enclosed fence. Gradually work up to direct contact, perhaps at a pet store."}, {"text": " \u2713 Expect to see some distress. This is the hard part for parents. No one likes to see their kids get upset. But you can\u2019t avoid having your kids feel modest distress if you want them to get over their anxiety. Sometimes, this part is more than some parents can handle. In those cases, a close friend or relative may be willing to pitch in and help."}, {"text": " At the same time, if your child exhibits extreme anxiety and upset, you need to break the task down further or get professional help. \u2713 Praise your child for any successes. Pay attention to any improvement and compliment your child. However, don\u2019t pressure your child by saying that this shows what a big boy or girl he or she is."}, {"text": " \u2713 Show patience. Don\u2019t get so worked up that your own emotions spill over and frighten your child further. Again, if that starts to happen, stop for a while, enlist a friend\u2019s assistance, or seek a professional\u2019s advice. The following story shows how parents dealt with their son\u2019s sudden anxiety about water."}, {"text": " Kids frequently become afraid when something unexpected happens. Penny and Stan plan a Caribbean vacation at a resort right on the beach. The brochure describes a family-friendly atmosphere. They purchase a snorkel and diving mask for their 3-year-old, Benjamin, who enjoys the plane ride and looks forward to snorkeling."}, {"text": " When they arrive, the hotel appears as beautiful as promised. The beach beckons, and the ocean water promises to be clear. Penny, Stan, and Benjamin quickly unpack and make their way down to the beach. They walk into the water slowly, delighted by the warm temperature. Suddenly, a large wave breaks in front of them and knocks Benjamin over."}, {"text": " Benjamin opens his mouth in surprise, and saltwater gags him. He cries and runs back to the shore, screaming.  28_574416-ch20.indd 295  3/22/10 9:57 PM  \f296  Part V: Helping Others with Anxiety Stan immediately pulls Benjamin back into the water. He continues to scream and kick. Penny and Stan spend the rest of the vacation begging Benjamin to go into the ocean again to no avail."}, {"text": " The parents end up taking turns babysitting Benjamin while their vacation dream fades. At home, Benjamin\u2019s fear grows, as untreated fears often do. He fusses in the bath, not wanting any water to splash on his face. He won\u2019t even consider getting into a swimming pool. Benjamin\u2019s parents take the lead and guide him through exposure."}, {"text": " First, on a hot day, they put a rubber, inflated wading pool in the backyard. They fill it and model getting in. Eventually, Benjamin shows a little interest and joins them in the pool. After he gets more comfortable, the parents do a little playful splashing with each other and encourage Benjamin to splash them."}, {"text": " He doesn\u2019t notice that his own face gets a little water on it. Then his parents suggest that Benjamin put just a part of his face into the water. He resists at first, but they encourage him. When he puts his chin into the water, they applaud. Stan puts his face entirely under water and comes up laughing."}, {"text": " He says that Benjamin may not be ready to do that. Benjamin proves him wrong. Benjamin and Stan take turns putting their faces into the water and splashing each other. What started out as fear turns into fun. The parents provide a wide range of gradually increasing challenges over the next several months, including using the mask and snorkel in pools of various sizes."}, {"text": " Then they go to a freshwater lake and do the same. Eventually, they take another vacation to the ocean and gradually expose Benjamin to the water there as well. If Benjamin\u2019s parents had allowed him to play on the beach at the edge of the water instead of insisting that he get back in the water immediately, he may have been more cooperative."}, {"text": " They could have then gradually encouraged him to walk in the water while watching for waves. That way, they may have been able to enjoy their vacation. They made the mistake of turning a fear into a power struggle, which doesn\u2019t work very well with children \u2014 or, for that matter, with adults.  Relaxing to reduce anxiety Children benefit from learning to relax, much in the same way that adults do."}, {"text": " We discussed relaxation methods for adults in Chapters 12 and 13, but kids need some slightly different strategies. That\u2019s because they don\u2019t have the same attention span as adults.  28_574416-ch20.indd 296  3/22/10 9:57 PM  \fChapter 20: Helping Kids Conquer Anxiety  297  Usually, we suggest teaching kids relaxation on an individual basis rather than in groups."}, {"text": " Kids in groups tend to get embarrassed. They deal with their embarrassment by acting silly and then fail to derive much benefit from the exercise. Individual training doesn\u2019t usually create as much embarrassment, and keeping kids\u2019 attention is easier.  Breathing relaxation The following directives are intended to teach kids abdominal breathing that has been shown to effectively reduce anxiety."}, {"text": " Feel free to use your own creativity to design similar instructions. Say the following to guide your child through each step: 1. Lie down on the floor and put your hands on your tummy. 2. Pretend that your stomach is a big balloon and that you want to fill it as full as you can. 3. Breathe in and see how big you can make your stomach."}, {"text": " 4. Now make a whooshing sound, like a balloon losing air, as you slowly let the air out. Excellent. 5. Let\u2019s do it again. Breathe in and fill the balloon. Hold it for a moment and then let the air out of your balloon ever so slowly as you make whooshing sounds. Repeat these instructions for eight or ten breaths."}, {"text": " Tell your kids to practice this exercise daily.  Relaxing muscles An especially effective way of achieving relaxation is through muscle relaxation. The following series of directives may help a child relax. Again, feel free to use your creativity. Have your child work each muscle group for about ten seconds before relaxing."}, {"text": " Then relax for about ten seconds. Talk your child through the exercises as follows: 1. Sit down in this chair, close your eyes, and relax. 2. Pretend the floor is trying to rise up and that you have to push it back down with your legs and feet. Push, push, push. 3. Okay, now relax your legs and feet."}, {"text": " Notice how nice they feel. 4. Oh, oh. The floor is starting to rise again.

Push hard and use your arm muscles, too."}, {"text": " Pretend you\u2019re squeezing Play-Doh between your hands and make it as squished as you can. 11. Okay, now relax. Take a deep breath. Hold it. 12. Now let the air out slowly. 13. Again, spread your fingers wide, and squish Play-Doh between your hands. Hold it. 14. Great. Now relax. 15. Pretend you\u2019re a turtle."}, {"text": " You want to go into your shell. To do that, bring your shoulders way up high and try to touch your ears with your shoulders.

Be a turtle and go into your shell."}, {"text": " Hold it. 18. Good. Now relax. 19. Finally, squish your face up like it does when you eat something that tastes really, really bad.

Good job! See how limp and relaxed your body feels. When you feel upset or worried, you can do this all by yourself to feel better. You don\u2019t have to do all the muscles like we did.

Reading rids their mind of worries and concerns from the day. You can also find various books and tapes specifically designed for helping kids relax. Unfortunately, some of the tapes use imagery of beautiful, relaxing scenes that kids may find rather boring."}, {"text": " Rather than beautiful scenes of beaches and lakes, kids can relax quite nicely to more fanciful scenes that appeal to their sense of fun and joy. The scenes don\u2019t need to be about relaxation per se; they just need to be entertaining and pleasant. Again, the point is to provide engaging alternatives to worries and fears."}, {"text": " One great idea comes from one of our clients and that client\u2019s mother. You can design your own book with your child. This child, with a little help from her mom, wrote and illustrated each page of her own relaxation book as in the following excerpt, titled \u201cImagine Unicorns and Smiling Stars\u201d: Close your eyes and relax."}, {"text": " Imagine unicorns dancing. Imagine outer space. Look at the planets spinning and floating. Imagine smiling stars. See how happy they are. Imagine blue moons. See the moons smiling. Imagine nice aliens. They like you. Imagine spaceships soaring. Imagine unicorns dancing in outer space with smiling stars, blue moons, and friendly aliens in their spaceship soaring."}, {"text": " Now, relax. Dream wonderful dreams.  Exorcizing anxiety through exercise Exercise burns off excess adrenaline, which fuels anxiety. All kids obviously need regular exercise, and studies show that most don\u2019t exercise enough. Anxious kids may be reluctant to engage in organized sports. They may feel inadequate or even afraid of negative evaluation by others."}, {"text": " Yet it may be more important for anxious kids to participate in sports for two reasons. First, sports can provide them with important mastery experiences. Although they may feel frustrated and upset at first, they usually experience considerable pride and a sense of accomplishment as their skills improve."}, {"text": " Second, aerobic activity directly decreases anxiety.  28_574416-ch20.indd 299  3/22/10 9:57 PM  \f300  Part V: Helping Others with Anxiety The challenge is to find a sport that provides your child with the greatest possible chance of at least modest success. Consider the following activities: \u2713 Swimming: An individual sport that doesn\u2019t involve balls thrown at your head or collisions with other players."}, {"text": " Swimmers compete against themselves, and many swim teams reward most participants with ribbons, whether they come in first or sixth. \u2713 Track and field: An individual sport that has a wide variety of different skill possibilities. Some kids are fast and can run short dashes. Others discover that they can develop the endurance to run long distances."}, {"text": " Still others can throw a shot put. \u2713 Tennis: A low-contact and relatively safe sport. Good instruction can make most kids adequate tennis players. \u2713 Martial arts: Good for enhancing a sense of competence and confidence. Many martial arts instructors have great skill for working with uncoordinated, fearful kids."}, {"text": " Almost all kids can experience improvements and success with martial arts. \u2713 Dance: A sport that includes many variations, from ballet to square dancing. Musically inclined kids often do quite well with dance classes. In other words, find something for your kids to do that involves physical activity."}, {"text": " They can benefit in terms of decreased anxiety, increased confidence, and greater connections with others. Don\u2019t forget to include family bike rides, hikes, or walks. Model the benefits of lifelong activity and exercise.  Getting Help from Others The goals of childhood include learning how to get along with others, learning self-control, and preparing for adult responsibilities."}, {"text": " Children make progress toward these goals by interacting with friends and family as well as by attending school. If anxiety interferes with these activities, then consultation and professional treatment may be needed. In other words, if a child can\u2019t play, learn, or participate in activities because of worries, it\u2019s time to get help."}, {"text": "  Who to get help from We recommend that parents first turn to their child\u2019s medical doctor to make sure there are no physical reasons for a child\u2019s anxiety. Certain medications prescribed for other conditions can cause a child to feel anxious. The physician may decide to switch medications first."}, {"text": " If the culprit is anxiety, rather  28_574416-ch20.indd 300  3/22/10 9:57 PM  \fChapter 20: Helping Kids Conquer Anxiety  301  than a drug or physical problem, the medical provider may have recommendations for mental-health providers. The following tips may help you search more effectively. \u2713 Call your health insurance plan to see what type of coverage you have for your child\u2019s mental-health care."}, {"text": " Your company may have a list of providers in your area. \u2713 Call providers and ask whether they have experience and training in treating childhood anxiety. The therapy can seem like play to your child, but therapy should be based on an approach that has been shown to help children overcome anxiety."}, {"text": " We generally recommend practitioners trained in cognitive or behavioral strategies because their effectiveness has been supported most consistently by research. \u2713 Make sure the provider you choose has office hours that can accommodate several appointments. Although the treatment may be relatively brief, don\u2019t expect it to happen in one or two sessions."}, {"text": " \u2713 Ask what state license your provider holds. Don\u2019t seek help from someone without a license to practice mental-health counseling. Professionals who usually treat children may be clinical psychologists, social workers, counselors, or school psychologists. Psychiatrists can also be involved in treating childhood anxiety disorders; however, they usually prescribe medication."}, {"text": " We recommend that treatment for anxiety, especially for children, begin with psychotherapy rather than medication. We take this approach because of unknown side effects of longterm use of medication and the great potential of relapse when medication is stopped. In contrast, the new ways of thinking or behaving learned through psychotherapy can last a lifetime."}, {"text": " If your insurance doesn\u2019t pay for psychotherapy, consider this: A study reported in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology (2008) found that the medical costs of anxious children were almost 21 times higher than those without anxiety. Covering effective treatment for anxious children is cost-effective for health insurance companies."}, {"text": " Your medical provider may be able to advocate with your insurance company using this argument. Treating anxiety early can save considerable money and suffering in the long run.  What to expect at the first session Generally, the first session is a time for your child\u2019s therapist to learn about the problems your child is having."}, {"text": " You can expect lots of questions. Parents are almost always invited into the first session to provide information. You  28_574416-ch20.indd 301  3/22/10 9:57 PM  \f302  Part V: Helping Others with Anxiety may want to prepare for the first appointment beforehand by keeping a journal of what you\u2019re concerned about."}, {"text": " For example, consider taking notes on the following questions: \u2713 What happens? Does your child avoid certain situations? Is anxiety getting in the way of her schoolwork or her play with other children? Is she getting bullied at school? \u2713 When do your child\u2019s symptoms crop up? Is he fine at home with familiar people and afraid at school? Does he get worse when he\u2019s worried about a test or when meeting new people? Are there particular times when his anxiety seems better or worse? \u2713 How long have you noticed these symptoms? Have there been any changes in the family, such as the birth of a child, death, or divorce? Has your child experienced any trauma? \u2713 Do other members of the family have problems with anxiety? If so, what sorts of problems? \u2713 Has your child experienced any recent health problems or hospitalizations? Generally, what a parent or child says to a therapist is held in strict confidence with only a few limitations."}, {"text": " One important limit to confidentiality with professionals is that they\u2019re required to report suspicions of child abuse. Another limit is that they must report cases involving children who appear to represent an imminent threat to themselves or other people.  What happens in therapy? For young children, much of the work is likely to focus on the parents."}, {"text": " In other words, the therapist spends much of the time teaching the parents things they can do to facilitate their child\u2019s progress. This focus doesn\u2019t mean the parents caused the problem, but they often can do much to alleviate it. Older children and teenagers spend more time in discussions with the therapist, and parents\u2019 involvement varies more widely."}, {"text": " In either case, you can expect the therapist to give tasks to both parents and their kids to be carried out in between sessions. You should expect the therapist to discuss what the specific goals of the sessions are, as well as detailed plans for getting there.

Exercising Aerobically Anxiety floods the body with adrenaline."}, {"text": " Adrenaline, a chemical produced by your body, causes your heart to beat faster, your muscles to tighten, and various other body sensations that feel distressing. Nothing burns off adrenaline faster than aerobic exercise. Good examples include jogging; a long, fast walk; dancing; rope jumping; and tennis."}, {"text": "  Soothing the Body The most distressing aspect of anxiety is the way that it makes your body feel \u2014 tense, queasy, racy, and tight. Quick ways to temporarily break through the tension include the following: \u2713 Soaking in a hot bath for a good while. \u2713 Taking a long, hot shower. \u2713 Enjoying a 15-minute massage, such as in a chair or on a mat with an electronic heating and vibrating massager."}, {"text": " Of course, if your budget allows for a longer massage performed by a professional masseuse, that\u2019s great too!  Drinking Tea Keep a selection of herbal teas in your cupboard. Certain teas, like chamomile, reportedly have relaxing properties.

One of the best ways of dealing with anxiety is to examine the evidence for your anxious thoughts. First, write down what you\u2019re worried about. Afterwards, ask yourself some questions about those thoughts, such as \u2713 Is this worry truly as awful as I\u2019m thinking it is? \u2713 Could some evidence contradict my anxious thoughts? \u2713 In a year, how important will this event be to me? \u2713 Am I making a dire prediction without any real basis? After answering these questions, try to write down a more realistic perspective."}, {"text": " See Chapter 5 for discovering more about how to write out your anxious thoughts, analyze them for distortions, and replace them with more realistic, calmer thoughts.  Listening to Music Sounds influence the way you feel. Think about it. If you listen to fingernails scraping across a blackboard, how do you feel? Most people (us included) report that it gives them a creepy, anxious feeling."}, {"text": " Just as unpleasant sounds jangle the nerves, soothing sounds can calm you. Select music that you find relaxing. Get comfortable and close your eyes. Turn the volume to a comforting level. Relax. Listen.  Finding Distractions In general, avoiding your anxiety isn\u2019t a good idea. But until you discover better ways of dealing with it, sometimes distractions can help."}, {"text": " Remember, they\u2019re just a temporary bandage and won\u2019t last.

And, like aerobic exercise, it burns off adrenaline. What a perfect combination. On the other hand, some anxious people get anxious about their sexual performance. If that\u2019s you, don\u2019t try this strategy \u2014 at least until you overcome your anxiety about this issue."}, {"text": " And, if you don\u2019t have an available, willing partner, we don\u2019t recommend hiring one.  Staying with the Moment What are you worried about? Chances are it\u2019s something that hasn\u2019t even happened yet and may never occur. The fact is, almost 90 percent of what people worry about never actually happens."}, {"text": " And if it does occur, it rarely ends up being as catastrophic as the worriers predict. Therefore, we suggest that you focus on the here and now. What are you doing? Look around you. Notice how the air feels as it goes in and out your nose. Feel your feet and the muscles in your legs as you sit. If you still feel anxiety, study it."}, {"text": " Notice the various sensations in your body, and realize that they won\u2019t kill you.

Getting Support You don\u2019t have to face anxiety relapses alone. Talking with others helps you deal with emotional distress. A great source of such support can be found in your local newspaper.

Being an adventurous sort, I like to think of it as a climb up a mountain."}, {"text": " You\u2019ve seen snapshots of the summit, and from the bottom you can barely glimpse the summit through the clouds. But the only way to get there is up \u2014 one step at a time.  Different paths up the same mountain Imagine that you\u2019re getting ready to climb this mountain. (If you live in the Netherlands or the midwestern United States, get out your National Geographic for this one!) How are you going to get to the top? You could take some climbing lessons, buy the right gear, and inch your way up one of the rocky faces."}, {"text": " Or you could choose one of the many trails that meander up the mountain and take a leisurely hike to the summit. (Of course, you could always cheat and drive your car, but that would ruin my metaphor!) Although they all end up at the same place, every trail has its unique characteristics. One may take you on a gradual ascent through forests and meadows, whereas another may head steeply uphill over dry, rocky terrain."}, {"text": " From one, you may have vistas of lush valleys filled with flowers; from another, you may see farmland or desert. Depending on your energy and your motivation, you may choose to stop at a picnic spot en route and while away a few hours (or a few days) enjoying the peace and quiet. Hey, you might enjoy it so much that you decide not to climb any farther."}, {"text": " Perhaps you\u2019d rather climb one of the smaller peaks along the way instead of going the distance to the top. Or you may prefer to charge to the summit as quickly as you can without bothering to linger anywhere. Well, the journey of meditation has a great deal in common with climbing a mountain. You can aim for the top, or you can just set your sights on some grassy knoll or lesser peak halfway up the slope."}, {"text": " Whatever your destination, you can have fun and reap the benefits of just breathing deeply and exercising muscles you didn\u2019t even know you had.

If we can trust the reports of the meditators and mystics who have climbed the mountain before us, we can declare with some confidence that the top of the mountain harbors the source of all love, wisdom, happiness, and joy."}, {"text": " Some people call it spirit or soul, true nature or true self, the ultimate truth or the ground of being (or just being itself). Others call it God or the Divine or the Holy Mystery, or simply the One. There are nearly as many names for it as people who experience it. And some spiritual traditions consider it so sacred and powerful that they hesitate to give it a name."}, {"text": " As for the experience of reaching the summit, seasoned meditators use words like enlightenment (from ignorance), awakening (from a dream), liberation (from bondage), freedom (from limitation), and union (with God or being). An old saying likens all these words and names to fingers pointing at the moon."}, {"text": " If you pay too much attention to the finger, you risk missing the beautiful moon, which is the reason for pointing the finger in the first place. Ultimately, you need to experience the moon \u2014 or in this case the summit \u2014 for yourself. Of course, you may have no interest in lofty states and experiences like enlightenment or union."}, {"text": " Perhaps you bought this book simply because you want to reduce your stress or enhance your healing process or deal with your emotions. Forget about the Holy Mystery \u2014 a little more clarity and peace of mind would suit you just fine, thank you very much!

(Depending on your orientation, you may prefer to call it the water of grace or spirit or unconditional love.) Those who make it to the top get to dive into the pool that surrounds the spring and immerse themselves completely in the  Meditation\u2019s spiritual roots Although many ordinary folks are meditating these days (including, quite possibly, people you know), the practice wasn\u2019t always so readily available."}, {"text": " For centuries, monks, nuns, mystics, and wandering ascetics preserved it in secret, using it to enter higher states of consciousness and ultimately to achieve the pinnacle of their particular paths. Highly motivated laypeople with time on their hands could always learn a few techniques. But the rigorous practice of meditation remained a sacred pursuit limited to an elite few who were willing to renounce the world and devote their lives to it."}, {"text": " (See Chapter 3 for more on the history of meditation.) How times have changed! From Beat Zen in the \u201950s and the influx of Indian yogis and swamis in  the \u201960s to the current fascination with Buddhism, meditation has definitely become mainstream, and its practical benefits are applauded in every medium, both actual and virtual."}, {"text": " (Have you ever checked out the Web sites devoted to meditation?) Meditation has been studied extensively in psychology labs and reduced to formulas like the Relaxation Response (a simple technique for diminishing stress). Yet it has never entirely lost its spiritual roots. In fact, the reason meditation works so effectively is that it connects you with a spiritual dimension, which different commentators give different names, but I like to call simply being."}, {"text": "  \fChapter 1: What Meditation Is \u2014 and Isn\u2019t  Discovering the treasure in your own house In the Jewish tradition, they tell a story that has its counterparts in all the world\u2019s great meditative teachings.

In fact, some even merge with the water and become identical with being itself. (Don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t merge if you don\u2019t want to!) But you don\u2019t have to climb all the way to the top to enjoy the pure taste of being. The water flows down the mountain in streams and rivulets and nourishes the fields and towns below."}, {"text": " In other words, you can taste being everywhere, in everything, because being is the essence that keeps life going at every level. Until you start meditating, though, you may not know what being tastes like. When you meditate, you get closer to the source of the water and learn how to recognize its taste."}, {"text": " (Depending on their personalities and where they are on the mountain, people use different terms to describe the water\u2019s taste, such as calm, peace, well-being, wholeness, clarity, and compassion.) It doesn\u2019t matter where you\u2019re headed or where you stop on your way up the mountain; you still get to dip your hands in the water of being and taste it for yourself."}, {"text": " Then you can begin to find the taste of being wherever you go!  17  \f18  Part I: Getting Acquainted  There\u2019s no place like home \u2014 and you\u2019re already there!

Of course, you\u2019re not going to give up all your doing and striving instantaneously and just be, even when you meditate.

When you watch TV, study for an exam, cook a meal, drive your car, listen to music, or talk with a friend, you\u2019re being aware, or paying attention. Before you begin to meditate in a formal way, you may find it helpful to explore your own awareness."}, {"text": " First, notice what it\u2019s like to be aware. Are there times in your life when you\u2019re not aware of anything? Now, complete this thought: \u201cI am aware of. . . .\u201d Do this again and again and notice where your awareness takes you. Do you tend to be more aware of internal or external sensations? Do you pay more attention to thoughts and fantasies than to your moment-to-moment sensory experiences? Notice whether a preoccupation with mental activity diminishes your awareness of what\u2019s happening right here and now."}, {"text": " Next, pay attention to whether your awareness tends to focus on a particular object or sensation or tends to be more expansive and inclusive.  You may find that your awareness resembles a spotlight that flows from object to object. Notice how your awareness flows without trying to change it. Does it shift quickly from one thing to another, or does it move more slowly, making contact with each object before moving on? Experiment with speeding up and slowing down the flow of awareness, and notice how that feels."}, {"text": " You may discover that your awareness is drawn again and again to certain kinds of objects and events, but not to others. Where does your awareness repeatedly wander? Which experience does it seem to selectively avoid? Now, experiment with gently directing your awareness from one focus to another. When you pay attention to sounds, you may notice that you momentarily forget about your hands or the discomfort in your back or knees."}, {"text": " Try to focus on one object of attention for as long as you can. How long can you remain undistracted before your mind skips to the next thing?

The same is true for awareness: You may not be aware that you\u2019re aware, but you need awareness to perform even the simplest tasks. You can use light in a number of ways. You can create ambient lighting that illuminates a room softly and diffusely."}, {"text": " You can focus light into a flashlight beam to help you find things when the room is dark. Or you can take the very same light and concentrate it into a laser beam so powerful that it can cut through steel or send messages to the stars. Likewise, in meditation, you can use awareness in different ways."}, {"text": " To begin with, you can increase your powers of awareness by developing concentration on a particular object. (For a brief list of meditation objects, see the section \u201cDifferent paths up the same mountain\u201d earlier in this chapter.) Then, when you\u2019ve stabilized your concentration, you can, through the practice of receptive awareness, expand your awareness \u2014 like ambient light \u2014 to illuminate the full range of your experience."}, {"text": " Next, you can concentrate even further in order to cultivate positive emotions and mind-states. Or you can use awareness to investigate your inner experience and contemplate the nature of existence itself. These four \u2014 concentration, receptive awareness, cultivation, and contemplation \u2014 constitute the major uses of awareness throughout the world\u2019s great meditative traditions."}, {"text": "  Building concentration To do just about anything well, you need to focus your awareness.

Did you ever notice that most of the time, you have scant control over the whims and vacillations of your monkey mind, which may space out one moment and obsess the next? When you meditate, you calm your monkey mind by making it one-pointed rather than scattered and distracted."}, {"text": " Many spiritual traditions teach their students concentration as the primary meditation practice. Just keep focusing your mind on the mantra or the symbol or the visualization, they advise, and eventually you will attain what is called absorption, or samadhi. In absorption, the sense of being a separate \u201cme\u201d disappears, and only the object of your attention remains."}, {"text": " Followed to its natural conclusion, the practice of concentration can lead to an experience of union with the object of your meditation.

Of course, if you don\u2019t know how to work with attention, these instructions are impossible to follow. That\u2019s why most traditions prescribe practicing concentration first.

Of course, if you intend to maintain your practice from week to week and month to month, which is the only way to reap the benefits of meditation, you\u2019ll probably need to draw on some of those time-honored qualities that every sustained enterprise requires: motivation, discipline, and commitment (see Chapters 4 and 9)."}, {"text": " Though they\u2019ve gotten a bad rap in Western culture, where people generally expect to have their needs met right now, if not sooner, these qualities are actually not difficult to cultivate and in fact arise naturally when you\u2019re engaged in and \u2014 dare I say it \u2014 passionate about what you\u2019re doing."}, {"text": "  Troubleshooting the challenges As your meditation practice deepens and evolves, you may find yourself encountering unexpected challenges that you don\u2019t quite know how to handle.

Classical yoga: The path of blissful union When you think of yoga, do you picture people twisting and stretching their bodies into challenging poses?

Sufis repeat the phrase La ila\u2019ha, il\u2019alahu (\u201cThere is nothing but God\u201d), Christians say the \u201cOur Father\u201d or the prayer of the heart (\u201cLord Jesus Christ have mercy on me\u201d), Buddhists intone sacred invocations like om mani padme hum or namu amida butsu, and Hindus repeat one of the many praises or names of God."}, {"text": "  Essentially, mantras are sounds infused with numinous or spiritual power by a teacher or a tradition. When you repeat a mantra \u2014 either aloud, under your breath, or mentally (actually considered the most potent method) \u2014 you resonate with a particular spiritual frequency and with the power and blessings the sound has accumulated over the years."}, {"text": " The practice of mantra focuses and stabilizes the mind and protects it from unwanted distractions. For this reason, mantra recitation often accompanies more formal meditation practices. To experiment with mantra, just choose a word or phrase with deep personal or spiritual meaning for you.

Indian tantra: Finding the sacred in the world of the senses Many Westerners associate the word tantra with traditional sexual practices that have been adapted to appeal to a popular audience."}, {"text": " However, tantra developed in the early centuries A.D. as a major form of Indian spiritual practice and thought.

Tantric meditation frequently involves practices for awakening the kundalini shakti, believed to be a powerful energy associated with the divine feminine that resides at the base of the spine."}, {"text": " Once stimulated, the shakti rises through an energetic channel located in the spine and activates and opens each of the seven energy centers, or chakras, in its path.

Christian meditation: Practicing contemplative prayer The Christian equivalent of meditation, known as contemplative prayer, dates back to Jesus himself, who fasted and prayed in the desert for 40 days and nights."}, {"text": " In contemplation, says Father Thomas Keating, whose \u201ccentering prayer\u201d has helped revitalize interest in Christian meditation, you open your awareness and your heart to God, the ultimate mystery, who dwells in the depths of your being, beyond the reach of the mind.

It\u2019s your wholeness and completeness \u2014 before you began to feel separate or lonely or fragmented."}, {"text": " It\u2019s the deep intuition of being inextricably connected with something larger than yourself and with every other being and thing.

In more or less the order in which you may encounter them in meditation, I cover these layers in the following sections."}, {"text": "  Mind chatter When you turn your attention inward, the first thing you\u2019re likely to encounter is the ceaseless chattering of your mind. The Buddhists like to compare the mind to a noisy monkey that swings uncontrollably from thought-branch to thought-branch without ever settling down. Most of the time, you may be so caught up in this chatter that you\u2019re not even aware it\u2019s happening."}, {"text": " It may take the form of reliving the past or rehearsing for the future or trying to solve some problem in the present.

Here are a few pointers for telling the difference: \u2eec Feelings occur as a set of recognizable sensations in your body."}, {"text": " When you\u2019re angry, for example, you may feel tension in your shoulders and jaw and experience a rush of energy in the back of your head. When you\u2019re sad, by contrast, you may feel a heaviness in your chest and heart and a congested feeling in your sinuses and throat. Through meditation, you can discover how to experience your feelings directly as sensations, separate from the thoughts and stories that perpetuate them."}, {"text": " (For more on meditating with thoughts and feelings, see Chapter 11.)  \u2eec Thoughts are the images, memories, beliefs, judgments, and reflections that float through your mind and often give rise to your feelings. If you follow the word feel with the word like, you\u2019re probably voicing a thought or a belief, rather than a feeling."}, {"text": " You can practice breaking strong feelings down into their component parts by asking: What are the thoughts and images in my mind that keep me feeling the way I do? And what am I actually experiencing in my body right now, aside from my thoughts? Thoughts not only generate feelings, they often masquerade as feelings (so you won\u2019t actually feel the ones you have), attempt to talk you out of your feelings, judge your feelings, or suppress them entirely."}, {"text": " The more you can disentangle your thoughts and feelings, the more clearly and consciously you can relate with (and express) your inner experience.  range of bodily sensations, including tension, arousal, contraction in the heart, or waves of energy in the belly or the back of the head. Some of these feelings may be pleasurable, others unpleasant or even painful."}, {"text": " But emotions in themselves don\u2019t pose a problem. It\u2019s just that as long as you keep reacting to the dramas inside your head, you may be cutting yourself off from others and from deeper, more satisfying dimensions of your being \u2014 and you may miss what\u2019s really going on around you as well. (For more on working with emotions in meditation, see Chapter 11."}, {"text": ")  Grasping and pushing away At a somewhat subtler level of experience than thoughts and emotions lurks a perpetual play of like and dislike, attachment and aversion. The Buddhists teach that the key to happiness and contentment lies in wanting what you  \fChapter 5: How Your Mind Stresses You Out and What You Can Do about It have and not wanting what you don\u2019t have."}, {"text": " But often, we\u2019re somehow dissatisfied with what we have, while we yearn for what we don\u2019t have and struggle to get it. Or we may become deeply attached to what we have and then suffer when time and circumstances change it or take it away. Because change is unavoidable, this tendency to either hold on tight to our experience or push it away can actually cause constant suffering."}, {"text": "  Negative beliefs and life scripts Here\u2019s another nature metaphor for you: Imagine that your thoughts and emotions and even the dramas that keep running through your brain form the leaves and branches of some inner, subterranean bush or tree. (Think wild and uncontrollable here, like blackberries or bamboo."}, {"text": ") What do you suppose constitutes the root, from which the leaves and branches relentlessly spring? Well, you may be surprised to discover that the root is a cluster of beliefs and stories, many of them negative, that have formed as the result of what people \u2014 especially people who are significant in your life, like loved ones and friends \u2014 have done to you and told you over the years."}, {"text": " These beliefs and stories have intertwined over your lifetime into a kind of life script that defines who you think you are and how you view the people and circumstances around you.

To return to the bush metaphor, you can keep pruning back the branches, but you\u2019ll keep living out the same old story until you pull it up by the roots."}, {"text": "  The sense of separation Even deeper than your stories \u2014 some would say the soil in which the stories grow \u2014 lies a feeling of being cut off or separate from life or being itself. Although the meditative traditions teach that separation is actually an illusion and we\u2019re inextricably connected to one another, the sense of being separate runs deep indeed."}, {"text": " Often it dates back to early childhood experiences, when you were forced by circumstances to separate prematurely from your mother or some other nurturing figure. Sometimes it can be traced to the birth trauma itself, when you had to exchange your placental paradise for a colder, harsher reality.

Do any of them remind you of people in your life \u2014 past or present? How do these voices make you feel? Allow ten minutes for this exercise initially."}, {"text": " When you have the knack of it, you can stop from time to time during the day and pay attention to your inner dialogue.

At the end of the ten minutes, stop and reflect on your experience. Did you experience some distance from your thoughts or emotions? Or did you keep losing yourself in the thinking or feeling process? The point of this exercise is not to see how well you can track your thinking or feeling, but to give you the experience of being the observer of your thoughts."}, {"text": " Believe it or not, you\u2019re the thinker not the thoughts!

Next, an angry, vindictive voice would step in, arguing that her boss was an ungrateful autocrat and she should barge into his office and put him in his place.

The reason these thoughts and feelings seem uncontrollable is that they spring from a deeper story or life script that may be largely unconscious. For example, you may hold the subliminal notion that nothing you do is quite good enough, so you push yourself anxiously to make up for your shortcomings."}, {"text": " Or, quite the contrary, you may believe that you deserve more than you\u2019re getting, so you\u2019re unhappy with what you have. Perhaps you believe that you\u2019re inherently unattractive, so no matter how much you compensate, you feel embarrassed and uncomfortable around the opposite sex. Or maybe you see intimate relationships as inherently threatening, so you do all you can to avoid being vulnerable."}, {"text": " Your inner story or drama has a powerful momentum that carries you along, whether you\u2019re aware of it or not. Sometimes it may seem like a tragedy, complete with villains and victims. At other times, it may seem more like a comedy, a romance, a fantasy, or a boring documentary. The point is, you\u2019re the center around which this drama revolves, and you\u2019re often so enthralled by the scenery that you can\u2019t really see what\u2019s going on outside, in the real world around you."}, {"text": " As a result, you may be constantly acting and reacting excessively and inappropriately, based not on the actual circumstances but on the distorted pictures inside your brain.

As I mentioned earlier, it\u2019s this inner drama that causes most of your suffering and stress, not the experiences themselves.

Mindfulness combines concentration (highly focused awareness) and a more receptive awareness that simply welcomes whatever arises."}, {"text": " Because mindfulness grows like a house on a foundation of concentration, you\u2019ll need to strengthen and stabilize your concentration before you can proceed to the full practice of mindfulness. That\u2019s why the initial meditations provided here emphasize focusing on a particular object of concentration \u2014 your breath."}, {"text": " Ultimately, the goal of mindfulness meditation is to develop the capacity to be fully present for whatever is occurring right here and now. When you\u2019ve stabilized your concentration by focusing on your breath, you can expand your awareness to include the full range of bodily sensations \u2014 and eventually you can just welcome whatever presents itself in your field of experience."}, {"text": " Though supremely simple, this advanced technique can take years of patient practice to master, but you may have glimpses of a more expanded awareness after only a few weeks of regular meditation.

In the beginning, of course, you\u2019re going to keep wondering whether you\u2019re doing it right. But don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s no wrong way to meditate \u2014  except perhaps sitting and trying to measure how well you\u2019re doing!

The next day you\u2019re so overwhelmed by thoughts or emotions that you sit for 20 minutes without even noticing your breath. Welcome to the practice of meditation! The point is not to do it right, but just to do it \u2014 again and again.

For example, the Latin word spiritus (the root of both spirited and spiritual), the Greek word anima (from which we derive the word animated), the Hebrew word ruach, and the Sanskrit word brahman may sound quite different, but they have one thing in common: They all mean both  breath and spirit or soul."}, {"text": " When you follow your breath with awareness, you\u2019re not only harmonizing your body and mind, which gives you a sense of inner harmony and wholeness, you\u2019re also exploring the living frontier where body, mind, and spirit meet \u2014 and attuning yourself to a spiritual dimension of being.  Focusing on your breath Compared to surfing the Net or catching a movie on HBO, watching your breath may seem like a boring way to spend your spare time."}, {"text": " The fact is, the media have conditioned us to be stimulation junkies by flooding our senses with computerized images and synthesized sounds that change at laserlike speed. Recently, I heard the head of an ad agency brag about how his latest TV spot bombarded the viewer with six images per second \u2014 far faster than the conscious mind could possibly register them."}, {"text": " By contrast, paying attention to the coming and going of your breath slows your mind to match the speed and rhythms of your body. Instead of 6 images per second, you breathe an average of 12 to 16 times per minute. And the sensations are far subtler than anything you\u2019ll see or hear on TV \u2014 more like the sights and sounds of nature, which is, after all, where you and your body came from."}, {"text": " Besides, the great thing about your breath as a focus of meditation is that it\u2019s always available, always changing yet always more or less the same. If your breath were totally different each time, it wouldn\u2019t provide the stability necessary for you to cultivate concentration; if it never changed in any way, you\u2019d quickly fall asleep and never have an opportunity to develop the curiosity and alertness that are so essential to the practice of mindfulness."}, {"text": " As a preliminary to the practice of following your breath, you may want to spend a few weeks or months just counting your breaths. It\u2019s a great way to build concentration \u2014 and it provides a preestablished structure that constantly reminds you when you\u2019re wandering off.

If you lose track, return to one and start again. To help you concentrate, you may find it useful to extend the number in your mind for the full duration of the inhalation or exhalation, instead of thinking the number quickly once and then dropping it."}, {"text": " For example, allow \u201co-o-o-n-n-n-e\u201d to last as long as the inhalation, \u201ct-w-o-o-o-o\u201d to last as long as the exhalation, and  Getting to know your breathing When you first begin paying deliberate attention to your breath, you may be surprised and somewhat frustrated to discover that your body tenses up and your breathing becomes stiff, labored, and unnatural."}, {"text": " Suddenly, you can\u2019t remember how to breathe anymore, even though you\u2019ve been doing it just fine ever since your first breath at birth.

If your mind starts wandering on the inhalations, though, just go back to the first method until you feel ready to move on again. Eventually, you may want to simplify the practice even further by simply noting \u201cin\u201d on the inhalation and \u201cout\u201d on the exhalation."}, {"text": "  Following your breaths Begin by sitting and breathing exactly as you did for counting your breaths.

At the end of your exhalation (and before you inhale again), there\u2019s often a gap or a pause when your breath is no longer perceptible. At this point, you can allow your attention to rest on a predetermined touchpoint, such as your navel or your hands, before returning to your breath when it resumes."}, {"text": " Thoughts and images will definitely continue to skitter and swirl through your mind as you meditate, but don\u2019t worry. Just patiently and persistently keep coming back to your breath. Gradually, you may even develop a fascination with all the little sensations \u2014 of your belly and ribcage shifting and opening and changing shape as you breathe or of your breath caressing the tip of your nose, tickling your nostrils, and cooling your nasal passages as it enters and leaves."}, {"text": " You may also notice that your mind tends to quiet down or your thinking tends to change on either the exhalation or the inhalation.

You can begin by drawing your awareness slowly down through your body from your head to your feet; then switch to holding your whole body in your awareness at once. When your mind wanders off, just come back to  your body."}, {"text": " Or you can use the Zen approach of focusing on a particular part of the body, like the lower back or lower abdomen. When you find a focus that works for you, however, stick with it. The point is to develop your mindfulness, not to meander through your body in search of a place to meditate.  Expanding to sensations As soon as you\u2019ve developed a certain ease in following your breath, you can expand your awareness as you meditate to include the full range of sensations both inside and outside your body \u2014 feeling, smelling, hearing, seeing."}, {"text": " Imagine that your awareness is like the zoom lens on a camera. Until now, you\u2019ve been focused exclusively on your breath; now you can back away slightly to include the field of sensations that surrounds your breath. If you find it difficult to expand your awareness all at once, you can begin by exploring a sensation when it calls attention to itself."}, {"text": " For example, you\u2019re following your breath when a pain in your back cries out for your attention. Instead of staying focused on your breath as you would have done before, you can turn your attention to the pain and explore it fully until it no longer predominates in your field of experience. Then come back to your breath until you\u2019re once again called away."}, {"text": " You can also experiment with expanding your awareness to include one particular kind of sensation, such as bodily feelings or sounds. For example, you can spend an entire meditation just listening to the sounds around you, without focusing on any sounds in particular. In this way, you\u2019re able to balance the highly concentrated awareness required to follow your breath with the more receptive, all-inclusive awareness necessary to welcome a broad range of sensations."}, {"text": " This blend of focus and receptivity lies at the heart of the practice of mindfulness. As you get the knack of including sensations in your meditations, you can experiment with expanding your awareness to include the full sensate field  \fChapter 6: Meditation 101: Relaxing Your Body and Calming Your Mind (that is, hearing, seeing, smelling, touching, and tasting)."}, {"text": " Begin by following your breathing and then just open your lens wide, allowing sensations to arise and pass away in your awareness.

In fact, your mind deserves even more patience than a puppy because it\u2019s developed the tendency to fantasize, worry, and obsess through a lifetime of poor training.

Like following your breath, playing scales can seem incredibly boring \u2014 but week by week, you become imperceptibly better, until one day you graduate to playing simple tunes. And the more you practice, the more subtleties you notice, and the more interesting even playing simple scales \u2014 or following your breath \u2014 becomes."}, {"text": " The historical Buddha compared meditating to tuning a lute.

It isn\u2019t necessarily as difficult or as painful as it appears \u2014 and besides, it has some unique advantages."}, {"text": " For one thing, crossing your legs creates a solid, stable foundation for the rest of your body and tends to tilt your pelvis forward naturally at just the right angle to support your spine.

After you practice this approach for a period of time and your attention stabilizes, you can expand your focus to include your whole body, maintaining the same level of Zen-style concentration."}, {"text": "  When you know what it feels like to sit upright with your spine extended, you can rock your body from side to side like a pendulum, first broadly and then in gradually decreasing arcs until you come to rest in the center.

Now you\u2019re ready to begin your meditation. At first, you may need to use these techniques and images again and again to help you return to a comfortable, upright sitting position.

Then you can just forget about your eyes and let them do what they do. Each alternative has its pros and cons."}, {"text": " Keeping your eyes closed draws your attention away from external distractions and helps you focus on your inner experience. Unfortunately, it also encourages daydreaming and thinking. Keeping your eyes wide open is actually the most difficult position because it expands your awareness to include the full range of outer as well as inner experiences."}, {"text": " The good news is that this position makes it easier for you to rise from a sitting position and extend your meditation to your everyday, eyes-open activities. The bad news is that if you haven\u2019t developed enough concentration, you can easily be distracted by anything that crosses your field of vision."}, {"text": " I generally recommend that people sit with eyes half open, Zen style, gazing with soft focus  at a spot on the floor about 4 or 5 feet in front of them \u2014 in other words, looking down at a 45-degree angle. If you\u2019re feeling restless or distracted, you can close your eyes a little more (or completely); if you\u2019re feeling sleepy or dull, you can open them wider."}, {"text": " And if you find yourself staring, just relax your eyes and soften your focus. Hands: You can put your hands pretty much anywhere they feel comfortable, as long as you keep them there for the entire sitting period. Seasoned meditators generally put their hands one of two places: in their laps or on their thighs."}, {"text": " \u2eec In your lap: Try simply clasping your hands. Or you can attempt the more formal Zen mudra (hand position) in which your left palm is placed on top of your right about 4 or 5 inches below your navel, with your thumbs lightly touching near your navel, thereby forming an oval with your fingers. \u2eec On your thighs: Simply rest your hands there, palms down."}, {"text": " Or turn them up and, if you want, touch your index finger to the thumb of each hand, forming an oval in a traditional yoga mudra.

Discipline grabs you by the collar and sits you down day after day, even when the going gets tough.

Restraining yourself, both on and off the cushion Broadly speaking, self-restraint is the quality of mind that keeps you from acting on every impulse or desire that flits through your brain and that helps you discriminate between behavior that\u2019s useful and supportive and behavior that\u2019s unsupportive or even harmful."}, {"text": " If you\u2019re an athlete, you need selfrestraint to prevent you from eating junk food or staying out late when you\u2019re training for a big competition.

You can also work directly with unraveling the negative stories your mind tells you and dealing with challenging emotions, as I explain in Chapter 11."}, {"text": " Then again, you can take the approach I describe in this chapter: You can burn the clouds away by amplifying the natural warmth of your heart through practices designed to cultivate love and compassion.  \f156  Part II: Getting Started Before I show you how to do this, however, I\u2019d like to take you on a guided tour of the territory."}, {"text": " Yes, I know you know where your heart is. But have you ever explored it with focused attention? Do you know what causes it to close \u2014 and what keeps it closed? And have you ever considered all the ways you can benefit from opening it?

How Your Heart Closes \u2014 and How You Can Open It Again Needless to say, you weren\u2019t born with your heart closed."}, {"text": " As anyone who\u2019s ever spent any time with a newborn knows, babies have hearts that radiate love like the sun in the tropics.

Perhaps you\u2019re one of those rare individuals whose heart remains open most of the time. If so, congratulations! Or maybe you wrap yourself in a cloud cover \u2014 or something even denser, like armor \u2014 when you head out the door each morning, but lay it aside when you spend time with friends or family members."}, {"text": " Perhaps your heart naturally opens and closes in an ebb and flow like the weather.

Some factors that keep closing your heart Like most human beings, you close your heart, whether automatically or deliberately, because you feel angry, hurt, or threatened by others."}, {"text": " Perhaps you\u2019re afraid they\u2019ll take advantage of your kindness or crush your tender feelings with their insensitivity or restimulate painful memories. Or maybe you\u2019re just ticked off about all the times you\u2019ve been mistreated, and you don\u2019t want to let it happen again. We all have our own unique reasons for closing our hearts."}, {"text": " Whatever yours happen to be, they may be preventing you from getting the love you really want.  \fChapter 10: Opening Your Heart: Love, Compassion, and Forgiveness Here are some of the most common factors that close the heart: \u2eec Fear: When you\u2019re afraid, for whatever reason \u2014 of being attacked, criticized, manipulated, overwhelmed \u2014 you close your heart in selfdefense."}, {"text": " As one popular slogan puts it, love is letting go of fear \u2014 and learning how to trust, both yourself and others. \u2eec Resentment: When you hold on to old hurts and let bitterness and resentment build up in your heart, you shut your heart, not only to the people who hurt you but also to life itself."}, {"text": " \u2eec Unresolved grief: This natural human emotion can get stuck if you continue to mull over your losses and refuse to let go of the past. When grief fills your heart, you\u2019re reluctant to open it because you don\u2019t want to feel the pain inside. \u2eec Jealousy: Actually a brand of resentment, jealousy can close your heart to the person who has what you wish you had \u2014 and to yourself as well for being somehow \u201cinferior."}, {"text": "\u201d \u2eec Pain: Also known as hurt, this feeling, if allowed to build to intolerable levels, may cause you to board up your heart completely and post a sign saying, \u201cKeep out! No trespassing!\u201d \u2eec Grasping and attachment: As long as you\u2019re emotionally attached to having life go a certain way, you\u2019re going to close your heart as soon as other people interfere."}, {"text": " In fact, emotions like grief, pain, and even resentment are ultimately rooted in attachment \u2014 and the fear of losing what you\u2019re attached to. \u2eec Self-clinging: If you believe that you\u2019re an isolated individual cut off from other people and from your own essential being, you\u2019re going to hold on to your own little piece of turf \u2014 your own possessions, your own accomplishments, your own happiness \u2014 and close your heart, if necessary, to defend it."}, {"text": " Also known as ego in many of the meditative traditions, self-clinging perpetuates separation and gives rise to the other factors in this list. Ultimately, of course, only the most enlightened, selfless people can keep their hearts open all the time. I mean, we\u2019re talking Jesus or Mother Teresa here! As for the rest of us, we\u2019re going to keep closing our hearts again and again."}, {"text": " Only when we\u2019ve dissolved the barriers that separate us from others \u2014 which is what enlightenment is all about \u2014 can we keep our hearts open even in the most difficult circumstances. But, enlightened or not, you can definitely develop the ability to open your heart when you choose to do so. In fact, the regular practice of meditation gradually erodes the experience of separation that causes the heart to stay closed in the first place."}, {"text": " (For more on separation, see Chapter 5.) Who knows? One day you may open your heart and never close it again!  157  \f158  Part II: Getting Started  Kindness is the key Although the cultivation of an open heart definitely deserves a chapter of its own, it\u2019s traditionally considered the foundation on which meditation practice rests, rather than a separate technique or approach."}, {"text": " In Southeast Asia, for example, meditators are taught how to develop generosity, patience, and lovingkindness before they learn how to meditate. And Tibetan practitioners dedicate the benefit of every meditation to the peace and harmony of all beings, not just themselves.

Some good reasons for keeping it open Imagine that an extraterrestrial lands on Earth and tries to make sense of us human beings from our pop music. It would probably conclude that we regard love (whatever that might be!) as infinitely more precious than everything else combined."}, {"text": " But once the ET figures out how to measure love, it might be surprised to discover how little of the invaluable substance actually flows between us most of the time. Love, the ET would no doubt deduce, is not only precious, it\u2019s incredibly hard to find. For creatures who want to be loved, appreciated, even adored, we certainly go about fulfilling our desire in a curiously unfulfilling way."}, {"text": " Instead of manufacturing it ourselves in the little love machine inside our chests, we complain about not getting enough of it, search frantically for someone else to give it to us, and try to make ourselves more lovable by improving our looks or earning more money. But the truth is, the Beatles song has it right: The love you take is equal to the love you make."}, {"text": " In other words, the most effective way to get love is to generate it yourself. By cultivating caring, loving feelings, you can actually provide yourself with the nourishment you seek. At the same time, by radiating those feelings outward to others, you can touch their tender hearts and naturally elicit the same feelings in them, creating a flow of love that keeps circulating between you and building on itself."}, {"text": "  \fChapter 10: Opening Your Heart: Love, Compassion, and Forgiveness If you\u2019ve never experienced this kind of flow with someone yourself, you\u2019ve perhaps met people who live this way. Their eyes sparkle with positive regard, their words speak well of everyone, and they elicit love wherever they go."}, {"text": " Through the practices described here, you, too, can begin to generate a flow of loving feelings. It all depends on you. Here are a few of the innumerable benefits of learning how to love: \u2eec Energy and expansiveness: If you\u2019ve ever been in love (maybe you are right now!), you know how vital and alive you can feel when your heart is wide open."}, {"text": " Instead of the usual sense of limitation you ordinarily experience, you feel like you have no boundaries, as though you can\u2019t really tell where you leave off and the outside world (or your beloved) begins. \u2eec Peace and well-being: When your heart is filled with love, you feel happy and peaceful for no external reason."}, {"text": " In fact, love, happiness, joy, peace, and well-being are just different names and versions of the same basic energy \u2014 the loving, life-giving energy of the heart. \u2eec Good health: Yes, love is life-giving and life-enhancing. For one thing, it brings people together to create babies, and, in general, love contributes to optimal health by providing an immeasurable vital spark that not only nourishes the internal organs but also provides the body (and the person) with a reason to live."}, {"text": " Dean Ornish, M.D., author of Dr. Dean Ornish\u2019s Program for Reversing Heart Disease, found that love is more important than any other factor in the healing process, including diet and exercise. To heal your heart, he discovered, you need to open your heart. (For more on Dr. Ornish, see Chapter 2.) \u2eec Belonging and interconnectedness: As another old song puts it, love makes the world go round \u2014 and it certainly draws people together and keeps them connected."}, {"text": " When you open your heart to others, you naturally feel joined with them in a meaningful way. In the deepest sense, love is the source of all meaning and belonging. \u2eec Spiritual awakening: As they gradually erode your sense of separateness from others, loving feelings can eventually reveal the essential nature of life, which is, paradoxically, also love."}, {"text": " Ultimately, the Sufis teach, we are simply love searching for itself.  Discovering your \u201csoft spot\u201d One of my teachers, the Tibetan meditation master Sogyal Rinpoche, used to refer to the place inside where you feel tender, loving emotions as your soft spot.

In his book Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior, he explains that facing your fear and negativity and being willing to keep your heart open \u2014 even in the most challenging  circumstances \u2014 takes tremendous courage."}, {"text": " Although you probably think of warriors as impenetrable, unfeeling, and heavily defended, Trungpa takes the opposite view. The sacred warrior who practices meditation, he suggests, is not afraid to feel tender \u2014 or to communicate this tenderness to others.

Love begins with you You may find it difficult to feel love and extend it to others because you didn\u2019t get much of it yourself as a child.

The meditations provided in this chapter dig a well deep into your soft spot, where the waters of love never run dry."}, {"text": " (In fact, the love I\u2019m talking about doesn\u2019t belong to anyone; it just bubbles up from a mysterious and inexhaustible source.) You may need to prime the pump, though. That\u2019s why the traditional instructions counsel you to begin each meditation on love and compassion by focusing on yourself. When you\u2019ve filled your own well to the brim, you can begin to extend the overflow to include others as well."}, {"text": " Just as you can\u2019t really heal others until you\u2019ve healed yourself to a certain degree, you can\u2019t love others until you feel deeply loved yourself. Besides, you deserve love at least as much as anyone else. In the West, we often practice self-denial, while equating self-love with selfishness. Yet, the reverse generally holds true: People who love themselves give love more freely and generously than those who don\u2019t."}, {"text": " As a remedy for the widespread Western disease of self-criticism and selfdenial, the meditative traditions offer the practice of self-love. In particular, as you work with opening your heart, you can remember to keep your heart open to yourself even, paradoxically, when your heart is closed.  161  \f162  Part II: Getting Started  Appreciating your own goodness If you have difficulty extending loving feelings to yourself, you may want to take five or ten minutes to reflect on your good qualities or the good things you\u2019ve done in your life."}, {"text": " Go ahead, it won\u2019t hurt you! In the West, we have a cultural taboo against praising ourselves. Instead, we often focus on our shortcomings, which only ends up making us feel contracted and afraid. \u201cPride goes before a fall,\u201d chides the old slogan, suggesting that you\u2019d better watch out because any satisfaction you take in yourself or your accomplishments could  destroy you."}, {"text": " \u201cWho do you think you are?\u201d intones the childhood voice of an exasperated mother or father, unwittingly teaching shame and self-doubt.

Meditating with anger After practicing meditation regularly for several years in my twenties, I prided myself on being consistently calm and even-tempered and never getting angry."}, {"text": " Then one day, my girlfriend at the time confessed that she\u2019d had an affair with another man! Without hesitating, I picked up a cup from the table and threw it against the wall. I remember being startled by the sudden intensity of my emotions. One moment I seemed perfectly peaceful, and the next moment I was flying into a rage."}, {"text": " My anger may have been appropriate to the circumstances, but I certainly hadn\u2019t expressed it skillfully. Humbled, I headed back to the meditation cushion for some deeper investigation \u2014 after breaking up with my girlfriend, of course. Many people, especially women, have a taboo against getting angry because they weren\u2019t allowed to express their anger, even as children."}, {"text": " So they expend enormous amounts of energy trying to skirt around the feeling. Other people seem as though they\u2019re perpetually seething with current anger and old resentments, although they may not realize it themselves. When you meditate with your anger, you might begin by noticing where and how you experience it in your body."}, {"text": " Where do you find yourself tensing and contracting? What happens to your breathing? Where do you notice a buildup of energy? How does it affect softer emotions? As you continue to be aware of your anger, do you notice it shifting or changing in any way? How long does it last? Does it have a beginning and an end?  \fChapter 11: Meditating with Challenging Emotions and Habitual Patterns  Facing your demons The Tibetans tell a wonderful story about the great meditation master Milarepa, who lived about 900 years ago."}, {"text": " Milarepa sought out remote caves high in the Himalayas where he practiced meditation. Once, he found himself in a cave inhabited by a company of demons that distracted him from his practice. (Demons apparently frequented caves in those days \u2014 looking for some action, no doubt!) First, he tried to subdue them, but they wouldn\u2019t budge."}, {"text": " Then he decided to honor them and extend friendliness and compassion to them, and half of them left. The rest he welcomed wholeheartedly and invited to return whenever  they wished. At this invitation, all but one particularly ferocious demon vanished like a rainbow. With no concern for his own body and with utmost love and compassion, Milarepa went up to the demon and placed his head in its mouth as an offering."}, {"text": " The demon disappeared without a trace and never returned. Consider the story of Milarepa the next time you\u2019re struggling with your own inner demons \u2014 emotions and states of mind you find challenging or unpleasant. Imagine what might happen if you welcomed them instead of trying to drive them away!  Next, you can turn your attention to your mind."}, {"text": " What kinds of thoughts and images accompany the angry feelings? Do you find yourself blaming other people and defending yourself? If you investigate further and peel back the initial layer of anger, what do you find underneath? In my experience, anger generally arises in response to one of two deeper emotions: hurt or fear."}, {"text": " When you\u2019re hurt, as I was by my girlfriend\u2019s betrayal, you may lash out in anger against the one you believe hurt you. And when you\u2019re afraid, you may protect yourself with the sword and armor of anger rather than acknowledge your fear, even to yourself. Beneath the hurt and fear, anger generally masks an even deeper layer of attachment to having things be a certain way."}, {"text": " When circumstances change or don\u2019t go according to plan, you feel hurt or afraid and then angry in response. With anger, as with all emotions, set aside any judgment or resistance you might have and face the anger directly. You may find that it becomes more intense before it releases, but stay with it."}, {"text": " Beneath the anger may lie deep wellsprings of power, which you may eventually discover how to evoke without getting angry.  Meditating with fear and anxiety Many people are reluctant to admit they\u2019re afraid, even to themselves. Somehow, they believe that if they acknowledge their fear, they give it power to run their lives."}, {"text": " In other words, deep down, they\u2019re afraid of their fear! Men especially will often go to great lengths to hide their fears or anxieties behind  185  \f186  Part III: Troubleshooting and Fine-Tuning a facade of confidence or anger or rationality. At the other extreme, of course, some people seem to be afraid of just about everything."}, {"text": " The truth is, if you\u2019re human \u2014 and not bionic or extraterrestrial \u2014 you\u2019re going to be afraid or anxious, at least occasionally. In addition to the raw rush of adrenaline you feel when your physical survival seems to be at stake, you experience the fear that inevitably arises when you face the unknown or the uncertain in life \u2014 which can be quite often these days."}, {"text": " Ultimately, you\u2019re afraid because you believe that you\u2019re a separate, isolated entity surrounded by forces beyond your control. The more the walls that separate you from others crumble through the practice of meditation, the more your fear and anxiety naturally diminish. (For more on separation and isolation, see Chapter 5."}, {"text": ") As with anger, you can use your meditation to explore and ultimately make friends with your fear. After all, it\u2019s just an emotion like other emotions, composed of physical sensations, thoughts, and beliefs. When working with fear, it\u2019s especially important to be kind and gentle with yourself. Begin by asking the same questions you asked about anger: Where and how do you experience it in your body? Where do you find yourself tensing and contracting? What happens to your breathing? Or to your heart? Next, notice the thoughts and images that accompany the fear."}, {"text": " Often fear arises from anticipating the future and imagining that you\u2019ll somehow be unable to cope. When you see these catastrophic expectations for what they are and return to the present moment \u2014 the sensations in your body, the coming and going of your breath \u2014 you may find that the fear shifts and begins to disperse."}, {"text": " Then when it returns, you can simply call its name \u2014 \u201cfear, fear, fear\u201d \u2014 like an old, familiar friend. You may also want to amplify the sensations a little and allow yourself to shake or tremble, if you feel so inclined. You can even imagine the fear overwhelming you and doing its worst (knowing, of course, that you will survive) \u2014 an especially helpful approach if you\u2019re afraid of your fear, as so many people are."}, {"text": " Facing your fear directly without trying to get rid of it or escape from it requires tremendous courage; yet these practices also have the capacity to bring you into the present moment and open your heart to your own vulnerability.  Meditating with sadness, grief, and depression Most people find sadness easier to feel and express than anger or fear."}, {"text": " Unfortunately, they don\u2019t give it the time and attention it deserves because they were told as children to stop crying before they were ready. Life inevitably presents us with a series of disappointments and losses; unexpressed sadness and grief can build up inside and ultimately lead to depression."}, {"text": " (Many of the people I see in therapy suffer from mild depression, which  \fChapter 11: Meditating with Challenging Emotions and Habitual Patterns may also result from repressed anger or \u201clearned helplessness.\u201d For more on learned helplessness, see Chapter 5.) To make friends with your sadness, you need to hold it gently and lovingly and give it plenty of space to express itself."}, {"text": " As with anger and fear, begin by exploring the sensations. Perhaps you notice a heaviness in your heart or a constriction in your diaphragm or a clogged sensation in your eyes and forehead, as though you\u2019re about to cry but can\u2019t. You may want to amplify these sensations and see what happens. Then pay attention to the thoughts, images, and memories that fuel the sadness."}, {"text": " Perhaps you keep reliving the loss of a loved one or the moment when a close friend said something unkind to you. If you\u2019re depressed, you may keep recycling the same negative, self-defeating beliefs and judgments, such as \u201cI\u2019m not good enough\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t have what it takes to succeed."}, {"text": "\u201d As you open your awareness to include the full range of experiences associated with the sadness, you may shed some heartfelt tears \u2014 and in the process feel yourself lightening up and your sadness lifting a little. (To find out how to work with core beliefs, consult the following two sections of this chapter."}, {"text": ") Ultimately, as long as you\u2019re open to your own suffering and the suffering of others, you will experience a certain amount of tender sadness in your heart.  How to Unravel Habitual Patterns \u2014 with Awareness As you explore your emotions (as described in the previous section), you may gradually discover that they\u2019re not as overpowering or as endless as you feared."}, {"text": " With mindful awareness and naming, most emotions will flow through your body and gradually release. For example, as you gently investigate your anger or fear, it may intensify at first, then break and disperse like a wave on the beach. But certain persistent emotions and physical contractions, along with the thoughts and images that accompany and fuel them, seem to keep returning, no matter how many times you notice and name them."}, {"text": " These are the stories and habitual patterns that run deep in the body-mind like the roots from which recurring thoughts and feelings spring. (For more on these stories, see Chapter 5.) In your meditations, you may keep replaying a story from your past (including all the accompanying emotions and mind-states) in which you suffer some abuse or injustice."}, {"text": " Perhaps you see yourself as a failure and fantasize obsessively about an imaginary future in which you\u2019re somehow happier and more successful. Or you may worry repeatedly about your job or relationship because you believe you can\u2019t trust people or the world\u2019s not a safe place.  187  \f188  Part III: Troubleshooting and Fine-Tuning In his book A Path with Heart, Buddhist meditation teacher Jack Kornfield calls these habitual patterns insistent visitors and suggests that they keep returning in your meditation (and your life!) because they\u2019re stuck or unfinished in some way."}, {"text": " When you give them the loving attention and deeper investigation they require (applying the penetrating insight I discuss at length in Chapter 5), you may at first discover that they\u2019re more complex and deeply rooted than you had imagined. But with persistent exploration, they gradually unravel and reveal the hidden energy and wisdom they contain."}, {"text": " In fact, the more you undo your patterns, the more you release the physical and energetic contractions that lie at their heart, and the freer, more spacious, more expansive \u2014 and, yes, healthier! \u2014 you become. Here\u2019s a brief synopsis of the primary techniques for unraveling habitual patterns."}, {"text": " Experiment with them on your own, and if you find them helpful, feel free to incorporate them into your meditation. If you get stuck or would like to delve deeper but don\u2019t know how, you may want to find yourself a meditation teacher or psychotherapist familiar with this approach. (For more on finding a therapist, see the section \u201cHow [and When] to Seek Help with Your Patterns\u201d later in this chapter."}, {"text": " For more on finding a teacher, see Chapter 13. And for a more detailed treatment of many of these techniques, check out A Path with Heart by Jack Kornfield.)  Naming your \u201ctunes\u201d As a rather humorous way to start, advises Kornfield, you can name and number your \u201ctop ten tunes.\u201d (You can stop at five, if you prefer."}, {"text": ") Then when a particular tune recurs, you can simply notice and name it without getting embroiled once again in the same painful pattern. Merely another version of naming your experience (described earlier), this approach can be helpful but only takes you so far.  Expanding your awareness The part of the pattern that reveals itself to you in your meditation may be just the tip of the proverbial iceberg."}, {"text": " Perhaps you keep feeling tense in your lower belly and you don\u2019t know why. If you expand your awareness, you may discover that beneath the surface lies fear about the future, and under the fear lies a layer of hurt. When you include thoughts and ideas as well, you may find that, deep down, you believe you\u2019re inadequate."}, {"text": " So you\u2019re afraid you can\u2019t cope, and you feel hurt when people criticize you because it just corroborates your own negative self-image. By welcoming the full range of thoughts, images, and feelings, you create an inner spaciousness in which the pattern can gradually unfold and release. (Trust me \u2014 this approach actually works, though you won\u2019t get results instantaneously!)  \fChapter 11: Meditating with Challenging Emotions and Habitual Patterns  Feeling your feelings Patterns often persist until the underlying feelings are thoroughly felt."}, {"text": " That\u2019s right, I said felt \u2014 not merely acknowledged or named! Many people keep their feelings at arm\u2019s length or confuse them with thoughts or ideas. I could talk in the abstract about grief or fear, but it took years of meditation (and some skillful therapy; see the section \u201cHow [and When] to Seek Help with Your Patterns\u201d) before I knew how they actually felt in my body."}, {"text": " Other people (as I mention earlier, in the section \u201cHow to Meditate with Challenging Emotions\u201d) get completely entangled in their feelings. As you expand your awareness, ask yourself, \u201cWhat feelings haven\u2019t I felt yet?\u201d Feeling your feelings doesn\u2019t make them bigger or worse \u2014 at least not in the long run."}, {"text": " It actually allows them to move through and release!  Noticing your resistance and attachment As I mentioned earlier, what you resist persists \u2014 to which I might add that what you\u2019re attached to persists as well. If a particular story or challenging emotion keeps replaying in your mind, you might explore your relationship to it."}, {"text": " For example, you might ask: How do I feel about this particular pattern or story? Do I have a vested interest in holding on to it? If so, what do I get out of it? Or what am I afraid might happen if I let it go? Am I judging it as undesirable and struggling to get rid of it? If so, what don\u2019t I like about it? When you can relax and gently open to accept the pattern with awareness (as described in the previous sections), you may find that the pattern, which felt so tight and entrenched, relaxes as well."}, {"text": "  Finding the wisdom Sometimes recurring stories or patterns have a message to impart, and they won\u2019t stop nagging until you listen. If I keep having the same uncomfortable or difficult feeling during meditation and it doesn\u2019t shift or change with awareness, I may \u201cgive it a voice\u201d and ask it to speak to me as though it were a close friend."}, {"text": " \u201cWhat are you trying to tell me?\u201d I may ask. \u201cWhat am I needing to hear?\u201d Sometimes I discover that a tender, vulnerable part of myself needs caring, nurturing attention. At other times, I hear the voice of responsibility reminding me to tend to some important commitment.

No, I\u2019m not talking about psychotherapy or Prozac here \u2014 I\u2019m referring to spiritual beings or energies that purportedly exist for the sole purpose of inspiring and encouraging your spiritual evolution."}, {"text": " Western religions have their angels and saints, Hinduism and Buddhism have their deities and protectors, shamanism has its spirit helpers and animal powers. Now, you may not buy all this spiritual stuff, but I\u2019d suggest giving this exercise a try just the same. In place of spiritual allies, you may want to imagine people who have given you unconditional support in the past \u2014 or you could just stick to the image of a luminous sphere."}, {"text": " The point is, this exercise by itself can be a powerful ally in the process of dealing with painful or difficult emotions or experiences. As with all meditations, the more you practice it, the more effective it becomes. (For detailed audio instructions, check out Track 9 on the CD.) 1. Begin by sitting down and meditating in your usual way for several minutes."}, {"text": " If you don\u2019t have a usual way, you can find one in Chapter 6 \u2014 or just sit quietly and wait for further instructions. 2. Imagine a luminous sphere of white light suspended about a foot above your head and slightly in front of you. Like a sun, this sphere embodies and radiates all the positive, healing, harmonious qualities you most want to manifest in your life right now."}, {"text": " (You may want to be specific  at first \u2014 strength, clarity, peace, love; eventually, you can just flash on the light.) 3. Imagine yourself soaking up all these qualities with the healing light as though you were sunbathing. 4. Imagine this light radiating in all directions to the farthest corners of the universe and drawing the energy of all the benevolent forces that support your growth and evolution back into the sphere."}, {"text": " 5. Visualize this positive, healing energy shining from the sphere, like the light of a thousand suns, streaming down through your body and mind, eliminating all negativity and tension, darkness and depression, worry and anxiety and replacing them with radiance, vitality, peace, and all the other positive qualities you seek."}, {"text": " 6. Continue to imagine this powerful, healing light flooding every cell and molecule of your being, dissolving any contractions and stuck places you may be aware of and leaving you clean, clear, and calm. 7. Visualize this luminous sphere gradually descending into your heart, where it continues to radiate this powerful light."}, {"text": " 8. Imagine yourself as a luminous being with a sphere of light in your heart that constantly radiates clarity, harmony, and purity \u2014 first to every cell and particle of your own being and then, through you, to every other being in every direction.

(When I use the term energetic here, I\u2019m referring to the Eastern model of the human organism as a system of energetic pathways and centers that can get blocked or contracted. These blockages give rise to painful emotions and mind-states and may ultimately cause disease."}, {"text": " For more on energy pathways and centers, see Chapter 12.) To explore the energetic contraction at the heart of your pattern, you can gently direct your awareness into the very center of the contraction and describe in detail what you find there. When you unearth the memory, feeling, or belief that holds the pattern together, you may find that the contraction releases, your awareness expands, and your meditation begins to flow more smoothly."}, {"text": " (Note: When you\u2019re dealing with exceptionally painful, deep-seated contractions, you may want to consult a qualified professional. See the section in this chapter \u201cHow [and When] to Seek Help with Your Patterns.\u201d)  Infusing the stuck place with being After you\u2019ve meditated for a while and received some glimpses of your own inherent wholeness and completeness (which I call being in Chapter 1), you may want to try the following shortcut."}, {"text": " Set aside the thoughts and ideas that accompany your pattern and simply be aware of the physical and energetic contraction. Now shift your attention to your wholeness and completeness, which you may experience as a calm, relaxed energy in your body; a deeply loving feeling in your heart; a sense of expansiveness or space; or some other feeling unique to you."}, {"text": " Imagine your wholeness and completeness gradually spreading, penetrating, and infusing the contraction with pure being. Continue this exercise as the contraction releases and dissolves into being. (For an even more powerful version of this technique, refer to the sidebar \u201cReplacing negative patterns with positive energy."}, {"text": "\u201d)  Working with patterns before you get stuck When you get the knack of observing your reactive patterns and repetitive stories and concerns and unraveling them in meditation, you can begin to work  191  \f192  Part III: Troubleshooting and Fine-Tuning with them as they arise in everyday life. For example, you may notice in your meditation that you tend to rehearse a drama in which other people are constantly depriving you of what you rightfully deserve and you end up feeling hurt and resentful."}, {"text": " When you notice this story and the beliefs that accompany it (for example, \u201cI never get what I want\u201d or \u201cNobody cares about me\u201d) showing up in your relationships or at work, you can use the skills you\u2019ve acquired to step back a little and resist the temptation to get sucked in as usual. The more consistently you unravel your patterns in meditation, the more quickly you can catch them as they arise \u2014 and the freer and less reactive you gradually become."}, {"text": " Eventually, you can even begin to shift your identity from the patterns to the spacious awareness in which the patterns arise and pass away.  Working with habitual patterns: A case in point Here\u2019s an example of how to work with habitual patterns, based on my own experience. Not long ago, I noticed a particular tightness in my lower abdomen, not only when I meditated but also between sessions."}, {"text": " When the tightness persisted for several days, I decided to investigate it further. Gently, I directed my awareness and my breath to the area.  Soon, it began to loosen a little, but not to unravel completely. Then I gently asked for more information, and I realized that I was afraid of an upcoming presentation."}, {"text": " Several memories of being made to feel inadequate as a child came vividly to mind, and I experienced waves of sadness and some tears, followed by compassion for myself.  As I expanded my awareness, I noticed that I also felt tight in my throat and jaw. When I inquired into the feeling, I gradually became aware that I was afraid of something, though I wasn\u2019t sure at first of what."}, {"text": " Not only that, I was resisting the feeling by tightening my jaw. Somehow I didn\u2019t like the feeling and wanted to get rid of it.  Now, as I directed my awareness to the center of the contraction in my belly, it quickly released, and feelings of ease and well-being filled the area instead. Feeling more relaxed and expanded, I returned to my usual meditation."}, {"text": " Several days later, when I made the presentation, I noticed that I felt more relaxed and selfconfident than usual.  Without trying to change the feeling in any way, I meditated and breathed with it for a while.  \fChapter 11: Meditating with Challenging Emotions and Habitual Patterns  How to Set Patterns Aside \u2014 for Now If you find that your habitual patterns are too deeply entrenched to unravel (at least for now!), you can still get some temporary relief by applying one or more of the following techniques."}, {"text": " You don\u2019t necessarily have to wrestle a pattern to the mat for the count of ten; sometimes you just have to get it to shift or budge a little so that you can get on with your meditation.  Letting go \u2014 or letting be Believe it or not, you may be able to drop the pattern and move on. Be careful, though \u2014 if you\u2019re actually trying to push it away, it may come back to haunt you."}, {"text": " Instead of struggle and aversion, this approach requires a willingness to accept things the way they are. (For more on the stages of letting go, see Chapter 9.) Sometimes you can just stop, be aware of the contraction, and gradually relax your body until the contraction releases. (For detailed instructions on how to relax deeply, see Chapter 6."}, {"text": ") Or you can shift your awareness to being itself (however you may happen to experience being), and just let the pattern be without trying to change it.  Shifting attention As the Bible says, \u201cThere\u2019s a time for every purpose under heaven\u201d \u2014 including working with your habitual patterns. If you\u2019re preoccupied with more-pressing concerns, you may need to be able to set your patterns aside and shine your attention where you need it most."}, {"text": " You can come back to your difficulties later, when you have the time and energy.  Moving the energy Sometimes you may find it helpful to direct the energy bound up in a particular pattern into another activity. Go for a run or dance to loud music or wash the dishes. You may not be unraveling the pattern, but you\u2019re stealing its thunder, so to speak."}, {"text": " (To continue the metaphor, you can even use the rain to water your crops.) Perhaps you\u2019ve seen one of those westerns where the hero goes out and chops some wood instead of picking up his gun and shooting his neighbors. Well, he\u2019s \u201cmoving the energy,\u201d whether he knows it or not.  193  \f194  Part III: Troubleshooting and Fine-Tuning You can also move the energy internally \u2014 for example, by turning your fear about an upcoming event into excitement and curiosity."}, {"text": "  Acting it out in imagination When an emotion or impulse seems too intense to shift or move, you can act it out in your meditation by imagining yourself exaggerating it and then allowing it to unfold completely with mindful attention. This approach differs from mere fantasy, which tends to have an obsessive, unconscious quality."}, {"text": " Instead, by paying attention as you give this emotion or pattern free rein, you get to realize that it\u2019s not as overpowering as you may have believed. At the same time, you have an opportunity to observe its limitations and the damage or pain it could inflict. For example, you could imagine yourself enacting your rage or your desire mindfully and notice what happens."}, {"text": " Does it completely overwhelm you? How does it affect the other people involved? Does it really bring you the fulfillment you seek?  Acting it out in real life \u2014 mindfully When a pattern just seems too powerful to resist, you can act it out in life, as you usually do, but this time with mindfulness."}, {"text": " Notice how you feel in your body as you follow the enactment through to completion. For example, you may be bravely trying to resist your desire for a hot fudge sundae but rapidly losing your willpower. Instead, you may go for it while noticing every bite and every sensation, both during and after."}, {"text": " In fact, you can even try eating as much as you want. I guarantee that you\u2019ll transform your relationship to hot fudge sundaes in the process. (For more on mindfulness in everyday life, see Chapter 15.)  Focusing: Western meditation for getting unstuck Here\u2019s a meditation technique called focusing developed by Eugene Gendlin, a psychology professor at the University of Chicago, to help folks like you and me figure out where we\u2019re stuck and effect the necessary changes, both inner and outer."}, {"text": " (Although this technique uses the same term, it differs from the focused attention described elsewhere in this book.)

Begin by taking a few moments to settle comfortably and relax.  \fChapter 11: Meditating with Challenging Emotions and Habitual Patterns  2.

You\u2019re not looking for an intense emotion but something subtler and more elusive: a felt sense. (For example, a felt sense is the place inside that you consult when someone asks you, \u201cWhat is your sense of that person or situation?\u201d It\u2019s not a feeling, exactly, and definitely not a thought, but more like a bodily knowing."}, {"text": ")  8. When you receive an answer that feels right, sit with it in silence for a few moments and allow your body to respond.  3. Take whatever you get, set it aside, and ask the same questions again until you have a list of three or four things you might focus on right now. 4. Choose one, but don\u2019t go inside it."}, {"text": " Instead, allow some space around it. Set aside any thoughts and analyses you may have and just be with your felt sense of this one thing, in its entirety. 5. Ask yourself, \u201cWhat is the crux of this problem?\u201d Don\u2019t jump to any conclusions or try to understand it. Just allow this crux to emerge in the silence."}, {"text": " You may find that what you get is different from what your mind expected. You\u2019ll know it in your body. 6. Sit with the crux of this felt sense for a minute or more and allow a word, image, or feeling to emerge from it. Don\u2019t try to understand it. Just be aware of the crux with gentle curiosity, waiting for a deeper knowing to reveal itself."}, {"text": " 7. Compare this word, image, or feeling with the felt sense in your body, asking \u201cIs this right? Does this really fit?\u201d If it is, you\u2019ll notice a felt shift: a deep breath, sigh of relief, or slight relaxing inside. If not,  The felt shift may continue to unfold, or you may experience a release of energy or some other noticeable reverberation in your body."}, {"text": " Here\u2019s an example of focusing. Say that you\u2019ve been obsessing about a conversation you had yesterday with a friend, playing it over and over again in your mind without resolution. So, you decide to set your thoughts aside and pay attention to your inner felt sense of the conversation. When you turn inward, you find that the felt sense is localized in your heart and the crux of it turns out to be something about your friend\u2019s tone of voice."}, {"text": " As you sit with the felt sense, you realize that the crux of the problem is not her tone of voice exactly, but it\u2019s something that was triggered in you. What is it? Well, it\u2019s a feeling of jealousy . . . no, that\u2019s not quite right; it\u2019s a sense of not quite measuring up, of not being as good as she is \u2014 or even more accurately, of not doing what you really love, the way she does."}, {"text": " That\u2019s it, you\u2019re aware that you\u2019re not doing what you really want to do with your life, and your friend\u2019s words triggered that sense inside you.

You\u2019ve just completed a round of focusing, and you can use the same technique for any other problem or felt sense."}, {"text": "  195  \f196  Part III: Troubleshooting and Fine-Tuning  How (and When) to Seek Help with Your Patterns Perhaps you\u2019re so full of negative thoughts and feelings that you find it virtually impossible to concentrate, even in meditation. The voices (or images) in your head keep spewing forth worries, regrets, judgments, and criticism with such volume and velocity that you can barely hear yourself think."}, {"text": " Or maybe you can focus on your breath or recite your mantra with some success, but when a particularly compelling story or pattern gets triggered, you\u2019re swept away by the intensity. My first suggestion is to keep meditating regularly and see what happens. How do you feel after a few weeks or months of steady practice? Are you making any headway? Do you feel more calm and peaceful? Does your concentration deepen? If certain patterns persist, however \u2014 especially if they interfere with your capacity to do your work or maintain loving, satisfying relationships \u2014 you might consider psychotherapy."}, {"text": " Now, I know that some people still feel a little embarrassed or ashamed if they admit they need help with their problems.

The problem is, talk-only therapy gets there more slowly \u2014 and sometimes not at  \fChapter 11: Meditating with Challenging Emotions and Habitual Patterns all. Unless you happen to have a Robin Williams nearby, find a therapist who combines talk with one or more techniques that take you deeper faster \u2014 for example, hypnotherapy, guided imagery, active imagination, sand play, bodycentered therapy, breathwork, focusing, or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR)."}, {"text": "  Shop around If you want the names of appropriate therapists, turn first to friends, family members, or others who share similar interests or values.

Does the therapist listen to you carefully and hear what you say? Does he or she seem emotionally attuned as well as insightful? Do you feel comfortable in his or her presence? Do you trust this person with your most tender places and difficult issues? In the final analysis, you need to trust your feelings and your intuition on this one."}, {"text": "  Decide whether spirituality matters to you If you have a particular spiritual orientation \u2014 or are in the process of developing one \u2014 you may want to search out a therapist who comes similarly equipped.

Nobody ever said it would be easy, however \u2014 not all the time, anyway!  \f200  Part III: Troubleshooting and Fine-Tuning In addition to the difficult emotions and habitual patterns I describe in Chapter 11, every persistent meditator inevitably encounters at least a few of the many classical roadblocks or obstacles."}, {"text": " (Don\u2019t be put off by the word obstacle.

You\u2019re not doing something wrong when you get sleepy or restless or bored or keep putting off your meditation or wonder whether it\u2019s worth the effort. In fact, you\u2019re merely confronting more of the habitual patterns that cause you problems in every area of your life."}, {"text": " Meditation offers a laboratory in which to investigate these patterns with mindful attention so you can apply your results in your work, your friendships, or your family life. (The \u201cobstacles,\u201d in other words, provide grist for the mill of self-awareness and behavioral change.) As I encourage throughout this book, be sure to treat yourself and the roadblocks that arise on your journey with the same kindness, care, and curiosity that you would give to a close friend."}, {"text": " The point is not to push through roadblocks to some loftier place of clarity and repose. Rather, the obstacles themselves provide exceptional raw material for your lab work as you discover how to open to whatever arises in your experience with gentle, nonjudgmental awareness. Instead of obstacles, you might prefer to think of them as messengers bearing the gifts of increased energy, wisdom, and self-acceptance."}, {"text": " As I describe in Chapter 11, it can be helpful to begin by naming your experience before proceeding to further exploration.  Sleepiness Most of us sleepwalk through much of our lives, paying only minimal attention to what\u2019s happening around us. Have you ever driven home and wondered, when you arrived, how you got there? Because the point of meditation is to wake up and be mindful, it\u2019s no wonder that all meditators contend with dullness and dreaminess at least occasionally."}, {"text": " Probably the most common roadblock, sleepiness comes in a number of shapes and sizes. Begin by exploring your experience: Where do you feel the sleepiness in your body? What happens to your mind? Are you physically tired or just mentally dull? You may be yawning because you haven\u2019t slept well in days \u2014 in which case, stop meditating and take a nap."}, {"text": " More often, though, your mind will become foggy when you\u2019re resisting feeling some unpleasant or undesirable emotion like fear or sadness. You might ask yourself, \u201cWhat am I avoiding right now? What lies just beneath the surface of this sleepiness?\u201d (You could even extend this inquiry to the other moments of your life when you dull out or glaze over."}, {"text": ")  \fChapter 12: Troubleshooting the Roadblocks and Side Effects Once you\u2019ve been meditating for a while, you may find that you get sleepy when your mind settles down and no longer has lots of stimulation to keep it occupied. At this point, you may need to rouse your energy by opening your eyes wide and sitting up straight."}, {"text": " If your sleepiness persists, you can get up and walk around or splash cold water on your face to help you stay awake.  Restlessness When you have difficulty paying attention in your meditation because your mind is agitated, worried, or anxious and you\u2019re eager to get on with other activities, you can begin by naming the restlessness and noticing how you experience it in your body."}, {"text": " Perhaps you\u2019re tensing in your belly or head or have an uneasy feeling in your arms and legs. Maybe you notice that you\u2019re perched uncomfortably on the edge of your cushion, as though you were ready to jump off at any moment and grab a bite to eat or make a phone call. Notice also what your mind is doing."}, {"text": " Does it skip uncontrollably from topic to topic or worry obsessively about some upcoming event or responsibility? As much as possible, observe your restlessness without getting caught by the agitation \u2014 or seduced by the impulse to get up and go. You may also want to practice counting your breaths or some other concentration technique to help quiet your mind until you can resume your regular practice (or perhaps that is your regular practice)."}, {"text": " Like sleepiness, restlessness can also be a response to painful or unpleasant feelings you don\u2019t want to experience.  Boredom Like most people, you may believe you get bored because the object of your attention lacks value or interest. But you might want to examine your boredom more closely. The truth is, boredom arises because you\u2019re not paying close enough attention or you have some judgment or preference that keeps you from showing up wholeheartedly for the present moment."}, {"text": " In fact, most of us have become accustomed to constant stimulation and have difficulty sitting still when we\u2019re focusing on something simple like . . . well, like following our breath. Boredom, like restlessness, can prevent you from experiencing the subtler beauties of life \u2014 and meditation can provide a wonderful opportunity to explore your boredom."}, {"text": " Begin by naming it: \u201cboredom, boredom.\u201d How do you experience it in your body? What stories does the mind spin? Instead of reacting to your boredom, just let yourself be mindfully bored. You may become so fascinated by your own boredom that you\u2019re no longer bored!  201  \f202  Part III: Troubleshooting and Fine-Tuning  When fear is no longer an obstacle In her book When Things Fall Apart, the American-born Buddhist teacher Pema Chodron tells the story of a young Westerner who went to India in the 1960s."}, {"text": " He desperately wanted to overcome his negative emotions, especially fear, which he believed to be an obstacle to his progress. The teacher he met there kept telling him to stop struggling, but the young man took this instruction as just another technique for getting rid of his fear. Finally, his teacher sent him to a hut in the foothills to meditate."}, {"text": " Late one night, while he was sitting, he heard a noise and turned to see a huge snake with hood lifted, swaying in the corner. The young man was terrified. He sat facing the snake, unable to move or fall asleep. He couldn\u2019t use any meditation techniques to  avoid his feelings \u2014 he could only sit with his breath and his fear and the snake in the corner."}, {"text": " Toward morning, as the last candle flickered out, the young man experienced a flood of tenderness and compassion for all the animals and people in the world. He could feel their suffering and their longing, and he could see that he had been using his meditation to separate, not only from others but also from himself."}, {"text": " In the darkness, he began to cry. Yes, he was angry and proud and frightened \u2014 but he was also unique and wise and immeasurably precious. With deep gratitude, he got up, walked toward the snake, and bowed. Then he fell asleep on the floor. When he woke up, the snake had disappeared \u2014 and so had his desperate need to struggle with his fear."}, {"text": "  Fear Sometimes you sit down to meditate and notice that your mind is filled with fearful thoughts and feelings that weren\u2019t apparent before. Where did they come from? You may have been anxious or afraid about something but didn\u2019t realize it until you began to meditate. Or your mindful attention may have flushed old fears to the surface to be explored and released."}, {"text": " Perhaps you\u2019re afraid of your meditation itself \u2014 afraid that you won\u2019t be able to do it right or deal with your stress or afraid of what challenging memories or feelings might come up while you meditate. If so, you\u2019re not alone! Fear is one of the most pervasive and basic of human emotions \u2014 no wonder it rears its head in meditation."}, {"text": " You can use your practice as an excellent opportunity to work with your fear by following the instructions offered in Chapter 11.  \fChapter 12: Troubleshooting the Roadblocks and Side Effects  Doubt This roadblock can be an especially challenging one because it calls the whole journey into question."}, {"text": " \u201cDo I have what it takes to meditate? My mind never settles down \u2014 maybe I should try yoga or t\u2019ai chi. What\u2019s the point of following my breath? How can this practice possibly bring relaxation and peace of mind?\u201d Of course, asking questions and getting satisfactory answers is important \u2014 but when you\u2019ve decided to give meditation a try, you need to treat your doubts as grist for your mill, instead of constantly taking them seriously."}, {"text": " Doubt can also result from pushing yourself too hard and holding high expectations; in meditation you need to set your expectations aside (as I mention in Chapter 6) and just do it, with the faith that the benefits will naturally accrue over time. To develop such faith, you may want to read other books like this one that extol the virtues of meditation."}, {"text": " Doubt stirs up your mind and makes concentration difficult. Begin by naming your doubt and noticing the sensations it evokes and the stories it spins. With mindful awareness, doubt gradually settles down and recedes to the background. Eventually, all your little doubts may even coalesce into a great doubt that motivates you to inquire deeply into the nature of existence and come up with some answers for yourself."}, {"text": "  Procrastination Like doubt, procrastination can bring your meditation to a screeching halt. After all, if you keep putting it off, you won\u2019t be able to reap the benefits. If you tend to procrastinate in other areas of your life, you now have an opportunity to look beyond your usual excuses to the deeper feelings and concerns that fuel this pattern."}, {"text": " Take some time to ask yourself honestly \u2014 but also gently and without judgment \u2014 what gets in the way of your following through on your intentions. As described in the previous sections, you may be afraid or bored or have doubts about the value of meditation. Perhaps a self-sabotaging part of you doesn\u2019t want you to make the positive changes that meditation offers, and so it keeps undermining your efforts."}, {"text": " Or you may be too restless and distracted to find the time for the very activity that could help you deal with your restlessness and distractibility. When you get your meditation back on track, you can explore these patterns further. (You may also want to refresh your motivation or develop self-discipline \u2014 in which case, turn to Chapter 4 or Chapter 9."}, {"text": ")  203  \f204  Part III: Troubleshooting and Fine-Tuning  Hypervigilance The next time you see a loving new mother, notice how she attends to her baby. Does she constantly monitor his face for signs of illness or discomfort? No, if she has a healthy relationship with her child, she gently gazes into his eyes with warm and caring attention, but without anxiety or concern."}, {"text": " You might find it helpful to bring the same gentle, mindful attention to your meditation. If you tend to get obsessive or perfectionistic or laserlike in your focus, you may just end up getting more stressed out than when you began. Instead, relax your attention like a loving mother, noticing your experience without becoming concerned or tense."}, {"text": " You may also want to inquire into the deeper fear that may be motivating your hypervigilance. Hypervigilance may also take the form of constantly monitoring your progress, constantly asking \u201cHow am I doing now?\u201d The problem is, true progress in meditation involves simply being present without extra concerns like wondering how you\u2019re doing."}, {"text": " Again, you can relax your awareness and just let yourself do what you do.  Self-judgment Like fear, self-judgment is a nearly universal human experience, at least in the West. You may focus your judgment on your meditation \u2014 you\u2019re not doing it right, you don\u2019t know how to concentrate \u2014 or on your being as a whole \u2014 you\u2019re inadequate, unlovable, not quite good enough."}, {"text": " The judging mind may even disguise itself as an objective observer or a spiritual coach, constantly comparing your progress to some internalized ideal. \u201cIf you were like the Buddha, you would be totally calm and undisturbed,\u201d it might say. Or, \u201cIf you were a good Christian (or Moslem or Jew), you would experience no anger or fear."}, {"text": "\u201d Unfortunately, as one of my teachers used to say, \u201ccomparison kills\u201d \u2014 meaning that it tends to dampen the unique vitality and expression that belong to you alone and can\u2019t be compared with anything else. By naming or noticing your self-judgments, you can gain some distance from them, rather than take their word as gospel, as so many of us do."}, {"text": " What does your voice of judgment sound like? What stories does it foist upon you as truth? Does it remind you of someone \u2014 say, a parent or boss? Are you trying to push away parts of your experience because they\u2019re undesirable in some way? Notice how judgment feels in your body. When you get caught up in judgment, you may find yourself tightening and tensing in response."}, {"text": " As you become familiar with your judgments, you can begin to welcome them as old friends, not only in meditation but in everyday life as well \u2014 without buying their story.  \fChapter 12: Troubleshooting the Roadblocks and Side Effects  Attachment and desire Just as fear and judgment attempt to avoid or resist certain experiences, attachment holds on tight to what you have \u2014 while desire keeps trying to find something better."}, {"text": " When you\u2019re attached \u2014 to your career or your relationship or your material possessions \u2014 you may resist letting go when circumstances change. Who wouldn\u2019t? But attachment can be a setup for pain, because life has this curious tendency to do what it pleases, despite your preferences to the contrary."}, {"text": " With desire, the dissatisfaction of not having what you want and having what you don\u2019t want runs like a painful undercurrent just beneath the surface of conscious awareness. I\u2019m not recommending complete nonattachment and desirelessness here \u2014 after all, only the Buddha could pull that one off! Nor am I equating desire with pleasure \u2014 in fact, the experience of desire can be extremely unpleasant, like a tormenting itch that never goes away, no matter how much you scratch; true pleasure, by contrast, fulfills a deep and natural human need."}, {"text": " But I am suggesting that you can discover how to create some space around your desires and attachments so that you\u2019re not overwhelmed by the unpredictable ups and downs of life. (For more on attachment, see Chapter 5.) Attachment and desire can show up in your meditation in a number of forms. Perhaps you covet the moments of relative calm and become upset when your mind gets agitated or preoccupied."}, {"text": " Or you may have a particular fondness for certain thoughts \u2014 fantasies of financial success, for example, or images of last month\u2019s vacation \u2014 and find that you\u2019re reluctant to let go of them and return to your breath or your mantra. Maybe you\u2019re constantly lusting and longing for some imagined fulfillment that\u2019s just out of reach."}, {"text": " As with the other roadblocks, you can explore your attachment and desire, first by gently naming them as they arise and then by noticing the thoughts and sensations that comprise them.  Pride Here\u2019s a classic meditation scenario. You\u2019ve been sitting regularly for a few weeks, and one day your mind calms down like the surface of a still forest pool."}, {"text": " The next thing you know you\u2019re having the following thoughts: \u201cWow, I\u2019m hardly thinking at all, and I\u2019ve counted my breaths from one to ten now for at least five minutes.

Pride can also take the form of bragging to your family and friends about how often you meditate or merely feeling special and superior to others."}, {"text": " As I explain in the section \u201cAttachment and desire,\u201d you might want to investigate the thoughts and feelings that make up your pride. Underneath it, you may find some fear or insecurity or a desire to be loved and appreciated. Or you can remind yourself that meditation has nothing to do with achievement and everything to do with being present in the moment for whatever is arising."}, {"text": " As soon as you get puffed up about how well you\u2019re meditating, you\u2019re gone \u2014 so gently bring yourself back to your breath.  Hiding out If you\u2019re trying to avoid confronting certain problems or challenges in your life, you may turn to meditation as a convenient escape and end up logging hours on your cushion that might be better spent paying your bills or preparing for a career change or sharing your feelings with your partner."}, {"text": " The New Yorker magazine ran a cartoon a few years back that speaks to this issue: A Zen monk sits peacefully on his cushion, while behind a screen in the background lies a huge, chaotic pile of stuff. Meditation can help you calm your mind, open your heart, and face the fears and other feelings that may stand in your way \u2014 but ultimately you need to take down the screen and apply what you\u2019ve learned to the real world."}, {"text": " (In other words, meditation, like work, sex, and watching TV, can become addictive if you abuse it.) Now, you\u2019re not becoming addicted if you spend a half hour or an hour each day meditating \u2014 or even head off for a retreat every now and then. But if you find yourself hiding out from the challenges of life, pay attention \u2014 the themes that keep recurring in your meditation may not be distractions at all, but pressing concerns that require your response."}, {"text": "  Bypassing Just as you can hide out from life\u2019s problems, you can also use meditation as a convenient way to avoid facing deeper psychological and emotional issues. Particularly if you develop strong concentration, you can focus on your breath or some other object of meditation while actively suppressing unpleasant or \u201cunspiritual\u201d feelings."}, {"text": " I know people who, after many years of meditation in monasteries or ashrams, finally discover that they\u2019re literally sitting on a lifetime of unresolved grief, resentment, or pain.

Here I\u2019m talking about what consciousness researchers call altered states \u2014 nonordinary experiences of body, mind, and heart that, though essentially harmless, may be startling, confusing, or frightening for the neophyte meditator."}, {"text": " Some people meditate for years and never experience anything out of the ordinary. As a Zen monk, for example, I kept hoping for some dramatic breakthrough but got only the occasional insight to punctuate thousands of hours of meditation. Others sit down and within a few sessions begin to have glimpses of what researchers call the transpersonal dimension of experience."}, {"text": " A friend of mind has always seen angels and other transcendent beings, both on and off her meditation cushion. Meditation traditions differ too in how they regard such extraordinary experiences. Some teach that the point is simply to be here now \u2014 and anything else that occurs is merely a potential distraction."}, {"text": " Another New Yorker cartoon puts it succinctly: A grizzled old monk sitting in meditation turns to his young companion and says, apparently in response to a question, \u201cNothing happens next. This is it.\u201d If a moment of true awakening occurs, according to these traditions, it merely takes the form of a shift in perspective, without fireworks or flashy signs."}, {"text": " By contrast, other traditions view extraordinary experiences as meaningful or possibly even necessary landmarks on the path to freedom and awakening. (For more on spiritual experiences, see Chapter 14.) In mindfulness meditation, the method I describe in this book (see Chapter 6), you simply approach the extraordinary in the same way you greet the ordinary \u2014 with gentle, mindful attention."}, {"text": " The point is to welcome whatever arises \u2014 and in the process to awaken to who you already are \u2014 so any experiences you encounter along the way are just roadside attractions. Enjoy them and keep going. If they become distracting or painful, you may want to seek a qualified teacher. To help you deal with these experiences without getting sidetracked or overwhelmed, Buddhist teacher Jack Kornfield, in his book A Path with Heart, suggests that you keep in mind the following three guidelines: \u2eec Side effects are just that."}, {"text": " Don\u2019t get attached to them or take them as an indication of either spiritual accomplishment or spiritual failure. Just keep going.  207  \f208  Part III: Troubleshooting and Fine-Tuning \u2eec Apply the brakes if you must. If the side effects get too intense, stop meditating for a while and engage in more \u201cgrounding\u201d activities that connect you with your body and the earth, like working in the garden, getting a massage, or walking in nature."}, {"text": " (To help you ground, try the meditation in the sidebar \u201cWhat to do when you\u2019re feeling ungrounded\u201d later in this chapter.) \u2eec Appreciate altered states as part of the larger dance of meditation. Don\u2019t get caught resisting or struggling with them. Just try to welcome them as you do every experience."}, {"text": " The following subsections highlight a few of the extraordinary experiences you may encounter in your meditation, divided for your convenience into four separate categories. (For more-detailed descriptions of these experiences, I highly recommend A Path with Heart.)  Rapture and bliss When your concentration deepens (but sometimes before), you may begin to have nonordinary physical experiences known as rapture."}, {"text": " Perhaps the most common form of rapture involves the pleasurable movement of subtle (or not-so-subtle) energy through the body. As it moves, this energy encounters areas of tightness and contraction that open and release in response. The energetic releases can take the form of vibrations, trembling, or sudden or repetitive spontaneous movements known in the yoga tradition as kriyas."}, {"text": " For example, you might feel spasms going up your spine or involuntary movements of your arms or head. Although the energy of rapture is generally experienced as pleasurable, you might be understandably surprised and a bit disturbed to find your body moving in ways you can\u2019t seem to control.

Just remember that you\u2019re not going insane or doing something wrong if you experience rapture; in fact, rapture generally signifies a deepening of concentration."}, {"text": " As much as possible, keep meditating as you bring mindful awareness to your experience and allow the energy to do its healing work of releasing your stuck places. If the energy gets too intense, just stop meditating and do something ordinary and physical, as Kornfield recommends.  \fChapter 12: Troubleshooting the Roadblocks and Side Effects Rapture refers to more than just energy; it comes in other forms and flavors too."}, {"text": " For example, you may have chills or hot flashes for no apparent reason. Or you may experience your body as extraordinarily heavy and dense or as transparent and filled with light. Or you may have prickling or tingling sensations followed by waves of pleasure and delight. Rapture can take as many forms as the people who experience it."}, {"text": " As for bliss, it\u2019s the powerful rapture that accompanies a spiritual insight or unitive experience. Mystics from the Judeo-Christian tradition, for instance, often report experiencing bliss when they achieve the pinnacle of their journey: oneness with God.  Visions and other sensory experiences If you don\u2019t experience rapture, don\u2019t be disappointed \u2014 you may get your altered states in the visual channel."}, {"text": " My friend who sees angels also has visions of traveling to other realms in her meditation where she meets enlightened beings that teach and empower her.

Different pieces for different folks Just as you wouldn\u2019t take a hacksaw to a stick of butter or use your toothbrush to scrub your floor, you don\u2019t need to meditate three hours a day if you\u2019re just looking for a little stress-reduction, and you wouldn\u2019t want to limit yourself to ten minutes if you\u2019re determined to get enlightened by the end of next week."}, {"text": " In Chapter 4, I describe five principal motivations for meditation: \u2eec Improving your life \u2eec Understanding and accepting yourself \u2eec Realizing your true nature \u2eec Awakening others \u2eec Expressing your innate perfection Knowing which of these best describes you can help you determine both how and how much you meditate."}, {"text": " (Needless to say, most people fall into the first three categories; the other two are generally reserved for seasoned meditators.)

Others identify more with their feelings and may be drawn to meditation out of a deep desire to feel God\u2019s love or express their devotion or compassion or work closely with a particular teacher."}, {"text": " Still others focus more on their bodies and turn to meditation for physical healing or energy or power. These three types \u2014 people who are oriented toward their heads, their hearts, and their bodies \u2014 are described in a number of the great meditative traditions and in the Western scientific tradition as well."}, {"text": " Take a few moments to check out your predominant orientation. The head types immediately gravitate to the insight practices, the heart types to the devotion and compassion practices, and the body types to the relaxation exercises and healing meditations.

Focus on compassion practices or working with your emotions, but also relax your body or be mindful of your sensate experience. Ultimately, any of the basic meditations will help develop the different parts of you \u2014 heart, mind, and body \u2014 but be aware of your tendency to favor one over the others, or even to sidestep one entirely."}, {"text": " Also, life has an uncanny tendency to reveal your Achilles heel and show you precisely what qualities you need to develop, so pay attention.

The \u201cperennial philosophy\u201d: Where all religions converge Just so you don\u2019t think this spirituality stuff belongs to one particular tradition or another, I\u2019d like to point out that certain philosophers have surveyed the world\u2019s great religions, from Christianity to Zoroastrianism, and discovered that a common spiritual river runs through them all."}, {"text": " This river is called the perennial philosophy, and it consists of three interconnected currents or  233  \f234  Part IV: Meditation in Action principles.

Well, it\u2019s more likely to happen when you\u2019re open to it.

The first two have their counterparts in all the world\u2019s great spiritual traditions, and the third provides an example of devotional practice in the Buddhist tradition."}, {"text": "  Mantra: Invoking the Divine in every moment Throughout history, meditators and mystics in the great devotional traditions have recommended the constant recitation of a mantra (a sacred word or phrase usually transmitted directly from a teacher) to bring the devotee closer to the Divine.

Some teachers act more like spiritual friends, treating you with the camaraderie and equality you expect from a peer, while also sharing their wealth of understanding."}, {"text": " Others act more like traditional gurus, transmitting their understanding directly to you while actively pushing against your stuck places. (Of course, many teachers lie somewhere between these two extremes and combine a little of both styles.) Whatever their approach, however, all good teachers help create and sustain, through their relationship with you, a sacred vessel or space in which the difficult, wondrous, and ultimately liberating process of spiritual transformation can take place inside you."}, {"text": "  What to look for in a teacher Before I suggest what to look for in a teacher, I\u2019d like to encourage you to examine your expectations and preconceptions.

Not all teachers will have every one of these characteristics, of course, but the more, the better: \u2eec They\u2019re humble, ordinary, down-to-earth, not arrogant or inflated. In Zen monasteries, the head monk cleans the toilets."}, {"text": " \u2eec They\u2019re honest, straightforward, and clear, not evasive or defensive.

Most important, perhaps, you reconnect with your basic nature \u2014 pure being itself \u2014 which is complete and perfect just the way it is.

Unfortunately, these negative emotions may compound your suffering \u2014 and even amplify your illness \u2014 by causing you to tense up and contract."}, {"text": " When you meditate regularly, you develop the skill of opening to your experience, however unpleasant, and softening around it instead of judging it or pushing it away.  Creating space for all your emotions As you accept your experience in meditation, you create a welcoming environment in which your feelings can bubble up and release, rather than be  \fChapter 16: Using Meditation for Healing and Performance Enhancement suppressed or acted out."}, {"text": " (For more on meditating with emotions, see Chapter 11.) Research suggests that unexpressed feelings locked in the body form focal points of tension and stress that may eventually contribute to the development of life-threatening illnesses such as cancer and heart disease.

The healing power of imagery In her book Staying Well with Guided Imagery, psychotherapist and guidedimagery pioneer Belleruth Naparstek cites extensive research that establishes three basic principles behind the healing power of imagery."}, {"text": " These principles help explain the effectiveness of the meditations provided in this chapter, which use imagery extensively.

If you\u2019re not sure what I mean, just recall the last time you had a sexual fantasy or reminisced about a vacation and had all the emotions and sensations of the actual event. In one study cited in Naparstek\u2019s book, for example, 84 percent of subjects exposed to poison ivy had no reaction when, under hypnosis, they imagined the plant to be harmless."}, {"text": " In other words, their bodies believed the images their minds evoked and didn\u2019t break out in a rash! Other studies have shown that patients can use positive imagery to measurably increase the numbers of immune response cells in their bloodstream. \u2eec In the meditative state, you can heal, change, learn, and grow more rapidly."}, {"text": " Naparstek uses the term altered state, which refers (in her usage) to a calm, relaxed, but focused state of mind \u2014 precisely the state you cultivate in meditation. This principle also applies to problemsolving and performance enhancement: You can explore new behaviors,  279  \f280  Part IV: Meditation in Action improve existing ones, and make tactical breakthroughs far more easily in a meditative state than you can in your ordinary frame of mind."}, {"text": " (For more on meditation for performance enhancement, see the section \u201cMeditation Can Enhance Your Performance at Work and Play\u201d later in this chapter.) \u2eec Imagery gives you a sense of mastery in challenging circumstances, which reduces your stress and bolsters your self-esteem. When you\u2019re struggling with a health problem or a difficult assignment at work, you may feel flustered and helpless if you believe you can\u2019t do anything to control the outcome."}, {"text": " But if you know that you can use imagery to help your body heal or enhance your performance, you can regain your confidence and your hope in the future. Numerous studies have shown that people feel better and perform more effectively when they believe they have some control over their lives. In addition to these principles, Naparstek adds that emotion amplifies the power of imagery."}, {"text": " When you allow yourself to feel the images intensely as well as experiencing them fully in all your senses, you give them more power to heal and transform you.  Six healing meditations As I mention at the beginning of this chapter, you don\u2019t have to do any special exercises to enjoy the health benefits of meditation \u2014 just develop a consistent practice based on the instructions provided elsewhere in this book (and on the CD as well)."}, {"text": " But if you\u2019re struggling with a chronic health problem (or just want to improve your overall state of health), you may want to experiment with one or more of the meditations that follow.

You can begin by opening and softening in relation to the small aches and pains you experience when you sit in meditation and gradually work up to the larger pains, such as a bad headache, a sore throat, or a back spasm."}, {"text": " You can also do the moment-to-moment work of challenging the story your mind keeps telling you and returning to the bare sensation of the pain itself \u2014 which is inevitably more bearable than the worst-case scenario your mind fabricates. In his book Full Catastrophe Living, Jon Kabat-Zinn, who works with people in chronic pain at the Stress-Reduction Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, suggests going directly into the sensations of the pain and asking yourself the question, \u201cHow bad is it right now, in this very moment?\u201d Most of the time, he counsels, you\u2019ll find that the pain is tolerable after all."}, {"text": " Intense pain also has a tendency to flush out the unresolved issues and unfelt emotions of a lifetime, so don\u2019t be surprised if you need to turn to Chapter 11 for some guidance on how to work with difficult mind-states.

This shared practice may elicit any number of responses."}, {"text": " Some people relax more deeply than ever before. Others notice some fear of letting go or getting so close to another person. Still others glimpse a deep peace beneath all the usual turmoil and concern. Whatever you or your partner experience, you can welcome it (as much as possible) with openness and nonjudgmental acceptance."}, {"text": "  Great Mother Many meditative traditions feature an archetypal feminine figure who nurtures and heals and carries the pain of others. In the Christian tradition, she\u2019s Mary, mother of sorrows. In Buddhism, she\u2019s called Kuan Yin, who hears and responds to the cries of the world. Patterned after the good mother who loves her children unconditionally, the Great Mother can be invoked in whatever form feels most comfortable for you."}, {"text": " She has the capacity to ease your pain with her compassion and to help you heal into wholeness. 1.

Gradually, his mind became one-pointed, and by morning he had become the indomitable ocean itself."}, {"text": " From then on, the story concludes, no one in all of Japan could defeat him.  5. If you feel moved to share your pain with her in the form of words or tears, go ahead. Her infinite heart is filled with compassion; she welcomes your suffering as though it were her own. 6. Continue to surrender yourself into her arms and receive her love into your heart as you let go of your suffering and sorrow."}, {"text": " With each breath, you feel more complete, more whole, more healed. Gradually, you feel your own heart dissolve into hers. 7. Spend as much time as you need in the presence of the Great Mother.

Meditation also teaches you how to cultivate certain other qualities and skills that naturally contribute to making you better at your favorite endeavor, whether it\u2019s sports or business, gardening or studying, or simply washing the dishes or sweeping the floor."}, {"text": " Here\u2019s a brief list \u2014 if you think of any more, just let me know: \u2eec Increased focus and concentration: This one\u2019s a no-brainer: As you become adept at staying on task as you follow your breaths or recite your mantra, you can easily transfer this skill to working at your computer or playing ball with friends."}, {"text": " For the benefits of focus, just look at great athletes like Tiger Woods, Lance Armstrong, or Annika Sorenstam! \u2eec Minimal distractions: This little benefit is the flip side of the preceding one: The more regularly you meditate, the more quickly distractions fade into the background as your mind settles down and becomes one-pointed."}, {"text": " Needless to say, you work or play more effectively without a million irrelevant thoughts chattering away inside your head. As Yogi Berra once said about baseball, \u201cHow can you think and hit at the same time?\u201d \u2eec Being in the moment, free from expectations: Even though you may have a particular goal in mind \u2014 for example, winning the race, completing the project, landing the ball in a tiny cup 300 yards away \u2014 the paradox is that you\u2019re more likely to succeed if you set aside your expectations and keep your attention focused on the precise movements or tasks you need to execute right now."}, {"text": " Former Los Angeles Lakers coach Phil Jackson calls it \u201ctrusting the moment.\u201d \u2eec Enhanced mental and perceptual clarity: One of the fortuitous side effects of keeping your mind on the moment is that your senses become sharper and your mind quicker and more attuned to subtle details \u2014 which, needless to say, comes in quite handy when you\u2019re trying to do something well."}, {"text": " \u2eec Greater endurance and longer attention span: As you gradually increase the length of your meditations from 10 to 15 to 20 minutes or more, you gradually build your power to pay attention longer.

Some great athletes even report that they can see the whole game as though from above when they\u2019re playing."}, {"text": " \u2eec Mindfulness of self-defeating behaviors: When you expand your awareness in your meditation to include sensations and mental processes, you begin to notice repetitive patterns of thinking and feeling that cause you stress or inhibit your full self-expression (see Chapter 12). By extending this mindfulness to your performance (at work or play), you can catch self-defeating patterns and replace them with more productive, effective alternatives."}, {"text": " \u2eec Self-acceptance and freedom from self-criticism: Nothing dampens enthusiasm and inhibits effective performance more than the tendency most of us have to put ourselves down, especially under pressure. Through regular meditation, you practice accepting yourself the way you are and noticing the judgments as they arise."}, {"text": " Then, when the going gets tough, you can use your meditation skills to gently defuse the selfcriticism as you focus on doing your personal best. \u2eec Compassion and teamwork: In his best-selling book Sacred Hoops, Phil Jackson describes how he forged a world-champion basketball team based on the principles and lessons he learned in his study of Zen meditation."}, {"text": " In addition to focus, mindfulness, and the other factors listed here, Jackson emphasizes the role of compassion (which can be deliberately cultivated in meditation; see Chapter 10). \u201cAs my [meditation] practice matured,\u201d he writes, \u201cI began to appreciate the importance of playing with an open heart."}, {"text": " Love is the force that ignites the spirit and binds teams together.\u201d Besides the benefits of a regular meditation practice listed here, you can also do meditations that are specifically designed to improve performance.

In her book Staying Well with Guided Imagery, Belleruth Naparstek calls the first kind of guided imagery feeling-state imagery and the second end-state imagery.

You can decide in advance how many weeks you\u2019re going to do them, and then follow through on your intention."}, {"text": " Like meditation itself, the morning pages may become a habit you don\u2019t want to break. \u2eec Don\u2019t show them to anyone else \u2014 and don\u2019t read them yourself for the first few weeks at least. Cameron actually suggests not reading them for the first eight weeks, but don\u2019t be too concerned if curiosity overtakes you."}, {"text": " \u2eec Remember that the negative opinions of your Censor aren\u2019t true.

Take some time to remember this successful performance as vividly and with as much sensory detail as you possibly can. Where were you? What were you wearing? What exactly were you doing? How did your body feel? Who else was there? What kinds of feelings did this successful performance evoke? 4. When you\u2019re fully immersed in the memory and your positive feelings reach their peak, find a physical gesture that underscores these feelings."}, {"text": " For example, you might touch two fingers together or rest your hand on your belly. 5. Gradually let go of the memory, return to ordinary consciousness, and open your eyes. 6.

Or you may look in the mirror but edit what you see, either by criticizing yourself for your appearance or refusing to see your imperfections. Or perhaps you close your heart to your loved ones because they don\u2019t live up to your expectations."}, {"text": " You may be amazed to discover how much energy your mind consumes by refusing to accept what\u2019s actually happening right in front of you.  Instead, for the next ten minutes, just say yes. Whatever you experience, whomever you meet, however life presents itself to you, notice your tendency to resist or deny and instead say yes."}, {"text": " Yes to your feelings, yes to your partner or your kids, yes to your body and your face, yes to your life. As much as possible, keep an open, spacious, attentive mind. Of course, you\u2019re welcome to change what you don\u2019t like, but take a moment to say yes to it first. You may be so accustomed to saying no that you don\u2019t know how to say yes at first."}, {"text": " So feel free to experiment. Repeating the word yes to yourself can help get you started.

Besides, when you\u2019re tense, you can\u2019t do anything particularly well \u2014 and meditation helps you relax your body and reduce your stress so you can make better (and more enjoyable) use of your time."}, {"text": "  \f298  Part V: The Part of Tens As I explain in more detail in Chapter 1, most meditation practices are a blend of concentration and receptive awareness. With concentration, you discover how to stabilize your attention on a particular object, such as your breath or some other bodily sensation. Eventually, you can extend this concentration to work or sports or any other activity."}, {"text": " In fact, psychologists have a word for the total absorption that comes with intense concentration; they call it flow, a state of mind in which time slows down, distractions fall away, and activity becomes effortless and supremely enjoyable. With receptive awareness, you practice expanding your attention to include the full range of your experiences, both inner and outer."}, {"text": " The two together \u2014 concentration and receptive awareness \u2014 combine to create the kind of relaxed alertness you see in great performers, athletes, and martial artists. Now, you couldn\u2019t accuse them of being spaced out or ineffectual, could you?  How Can I Find the Time to Meditate in My Busy Schedule? Ah yes, the perennial issue: time! Well, the great thing about meditation is that it doesn\u2019t really take all that much time."}, {"text": " As soon as you pick up the basics (by reading this book, of course), you can begin by practicing for five or ten minutes each day. Mornings are generally best, at least to start. You may want to sandwich a little quiet time between brushing your teeth and taking a shower. Or if you\u2019re an early bird, you can enjoy the precious moments of stillness before the rest of the family wakes up."}, {"text": " Whatever time slot works best for you, the most important thing is to meditate regularly \u2014 every day if possible, give or take a day here or there (and some time to sleep late on Sundays). The reason for this recommendation is not to turn you into an automaton, but rather to give you an opportunity to enjoy the wonderful benefits of meditation, such as reduced stress and greater focus."}, {"text": " Like lifting weights or practicing a musical instrument, meditation doesn\u2019t really have an impact unless you keep it up and keep it regular. As you meditate consistently over the days and weeks, you may begin to notice little changes in your life \u2014 moments of ease or peace or harmony you may not have experienced since childhood, if ever."}, {"text": " And the more you benefit from your meditation practice, the more you\u2019re going to feel motivated to carve out the time \u2014 and perhaps even extend the niche from 5 or 10 minutes to 15 or 20.  \fChapter 17: Answers to Ten Commonly Asked Questions about Meditation  I Can\u2019t Sit on the Floor and Cross My Legs \u2014 Can I Meditate in a Chair or Lying Down Instead? Yes, absolutely."}, {"text": " In fact, traditional meditation postures include sitting, standing, walking, lying down, and moving in particular patterns (for example, t\u2019ai chi or Sufi dancing). Basically, any position that you can comfortably sustain is appropriate for meditation. (To find a posture that works for you, check out Chapter 7."}, {"text": ") Of course, lying down has its downside (so to speak): You\u2019re more likely to fall asleep. So, you may have to make a special effort (without getting tense about it, that is) to stay alert and focused. Also, you\u2019re better off lying on a mat or carpet, rather than on your bed \u2014 for obvious reasons! More important than whether you sit, lie, or stand for meditation is what you do with your back."}, {"text": " Slumping forward or tilting to the side, so your body fights against gravity, may eventually prove painful and make it difficult to sustain your practice over weeks and months.

To begin with, you may find it comforting to realize that you\u2019re not alone. Everyone experiences agitation or discomfort in his or her meditation from time to time \u2014 or even often. In fact, meditation acts like a mirror that reflects you back to you."}, {"text": " Believe it or not, that\u2019s one of its virtues. When you stop your busy life for a few minutes and sit quietly, you may suddenly notice all the nervous energy and frenzied thinking that have been stressing you out all along.

What Should I Do if I Keep Falling Asleep while I Meditate? Like restlessness, sleepiness is a common roadblock on the journey of meditation. (For more on roadblocks, see Chapter 12.) Even the great meditators of the past reported struggling with sleep \u2014 and some of them devised extreme measures for staying awake, like tying their hair to the ceiling or meditating on the edge of a cliff."}, {"text": " Talk about determination! Ordinary folks like you and me have the option of using gentler means to keep ourselves awake and alert while we meditate. First, you may want to explore the sleepiness a little. Where do you experience it in your body? Is it just mental dullness, or are you physically tired as well? Perhaps you should be napping rather than meditating! If you decide to keep going, you can try opening your eyes wide and sitting up as straight as possible to rouse your energy."}, {"text": " If you still feel sleepy, splash some cold water on your face or try meditating while standing or walking.

Meditators Have Lower Blood Pressure Everyone knows that meditation reduces stress, calms the body, and relaxes the mind."}, {"text": " Numerous studies have corroborated this finding.

No wonder that meditation has become such a popular practice among therapists, coaches, and others for whom empathy is an indispensable skill."}, {"text": "  319  \f320  Part V: The Part of Tens  Mindfulness Speeds the Healing of Psoriasis As a skin disease that\u2019s measurably exacerbated by stress, psoriasis offers an excellent proving ground for the effectiveness of meditation in facilitating the healing of stress-related ailments. In a 1998 study published in Psychosomatic Medicine, Dr."}, {"text": " Jon Kabat-Zinn, best-selling author and founder of the Stress Reduction Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, and his colleagues took 37 psoriasis patients who were about to undergo light treatment for their condition and randomly assigned them to one of two situations: a mindfulness meditation\u2013based stress reduction intervention during treatments or a light treatment alone."}, {"text": " The results were testimony to the potential value of meditation as an adjunct to just about any treatment regime: The patients who meditated not only responded better to light treatment than the non-meditating group, but their psoriasis cleared up four times faster!  Meditation Ranks with Chocolate as a Mood-Enhancer As every chocoholic knows, a single piece of the confection can lift you out of the doldrums and mellow your mood."}, {"text": " But not everyone knows that the active ingredient in chocolate is a close cousin of the essential amino acid phenylalanine, which enhances production of the neurotransmitters that keep us happy. In fact, one research study found phenylalanine supplementation to be as effective as a well-known antidepressant."}, {"text": " Well, the good news is that meditation boosts the body\u2019s natural concentrations of phenyalanine \u2014 without the added calories. In a study published in Physiology and Behavior (Jevning et al., 1977), researchers measured amino acid levels in 28 subjects, 15 of whom had practiced TM regularly for three to five years."}, {"text": " During meditation, phenylalanine levels in the TM group rose an amazing 23 percent, compared with no change during relaxation for the control group. So the next time you\u2019re tempted to reach for the chocolate, consider reaching for your meditation cushion instead!  \fChapter 19: Ten Meditation Research Studies \u2014 and What They Mean for You  Meditation Relieves Pain One of the best-documented clinical uses of meditation is the application of mindfulness for the alleviation of chronic pain."}, {"text": " During the 1980s, Dr. Jon KabatZinn and his colleagues published several studies proving its effectiveness. According to a report in the Journal of Behavioral Medicine (Kabat-Zinn et al., 1985), 90 chronic-pain patients who were trained in mindfulness meditation in a 10-week stress reduction and relaxation program experienced significant reductions in present-moment pain, negative body image, and the inhibition of activity."}, {"text": " Not only that, they popped fewer pain pills and felt better about themselves. At a 15-month follow-up, they were still doing better on all measures except present-moment pain, and the majority continued to meditate \u2014 not a surprising finding, given that chronic pain can be one of the most debilitating conditions imaginable, and one of the most difficult to treat."}, {"text": "\fINTRODUCTION  I found the Dalai Lama alone in an empty basketball locker room moments before he was to speak before a crowd of six thousand at Arizona State University. He was calmly sipping a cup of tea, in perfect repose. \u201cYour Holiness, if you\u2019re ready ...\u201d He briskly rose, and without hesitation he left the room, emerging into the thick backstage  \fthrong of local reporters, photographers, security personnel, and students\u2014the seekers, the curious, and the skeptical."}, {"text": " He walked through the crowd smiling broadly and greeting people as he passed by. Finally passing through a curtain, he walked on stage, bowed, folded his hands, and smiled. He was greeted with thunderous applause. At his request, the house lights were not dimmed so he could clearly see his audience, and for several moments he simply stood there, quietly surveying the audience with an unmistakable expression of warmth and goodwill."}, {"text": " For those who had never seen the Dalai Lama before, his maroon and saffron monk\u2019s robes may have created a somewhat exotic impression, yet his remarkable ability to establish rapport with his audience was quickly revealed as he sat down and began his talk.  \f\u201cI think that this is the first time I am meeting most of you."}, {"text": " But to me, whether it is an old friend or new friend, there\u2019s not much difference anyway, because I always believe we are the same; we are all human beings. Of course, there may be differences in cultural background or way of life, there may be differences in our faith, or we may be of a different color, but we are human beings, consisting of the human body and the human mind."}, {"text": " Our physical structure is the same, and our mind and our emotional nature are also the same. Wherever I meet people, I always have the feeling that I am encountering another human being, just like myself. I find it is much easier to communicate with others on that level. If we emphasize specific characteristics, like I am Tibetan or I am Buddhist, then there are differences."}, {"text": " But those things are secondary. If we  \fcan leave the differences aside, I think we can easily communicate, exchange ideas, and share experiences.\u201d With this, in 1993 the Dalai Lama began a week-long series of public talks in Arizona. Plans for his visit to Arizona had first been set into motion over a decade earlier."}, {"text": " It was at that time that we first met, while I was visiting Dharamsala, India, on a small research grant to study traditional Tibetan medicine. Dharamsala is a beautiful and tranquil village, perched on a hillside in the foothills of the Himalayas. For almost forty years, this has been the home of the Tibetan government-in-exile, ever since the Dalai Lama, along with one hundred thousand other Tibetans, fled Tibet after the brutal invasion by Chinese forces."}, {"text": " During my stay in Dharamsala I had gotten to know several members of the Dalai  \fLama\u2019s family, and it was through them that my first meeting with him was arranged. In his 1993 public address, the Dalai Lama spoke of the importance of relating as one human being to another, and it was this very same quality that had been the most striking feature of our first conversation at his home in 1982."}, {"text": " He seemed to have an uncommon ability to put one completely at ease, to quickly create a simple and direct connection with a fellow human being. Our first meeting had lasted around forty-five minutes, and like so many other people, I came away from that meeting in great spirits, with the impression that I had just met a truly exceptional man."}, {"text": " As my contact with the Dalai Lama grew over the next several years, I gradually came to appreciate his many unique qualities. He has a  \fpenetrating intelligence, but without artifice; a kindness, but without excessive sentimentality; great humor, but without frivolousness; and, as many have discovered, the ability to inspire rather than awe."}, {"text": " Over time I became convinced that the Dalai Lama had learned how to live with a sense of fulfillment and a degree of serenity that I had never seen in other people. I was determined to identify the principles that enabled him to achieve this. Although he is a Buddhist monk with a lifetime of Buddhist training and study, I began to wonder if one could identify a set of his beliefs or practices that could be utilized by non-Buddhists as well\u2014practices that could be directly applied to our lives to simply help us become happier, stronger, perhaps less afraid."}, {"text": "  \fEventually, I had an opportunity to explore his views in greater depth, meeting with him daily during his stay in Arizona and following up these discussions with more extensive conversations at his home in India. As we conversed, I soon discovered that we had some hurdles to overcome as we struggled to reconcile our different perspectives: his as a Buddhist monk, and mine as a Western psychiatrist."}, {"text": " I began one of our first sessions, for example, by posing to him certain common human problems, illustrating with several lengthy case histories. Having described a woman who persisted in selfdestructive behaviors despite the tremendous negative impact on her life, I asked him if he had an explanation for this behavior and what advice he could offer."}, {"text": " I was taken aback when after a  \flong pause and reflection, he simply said, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d and shrugging his shoulders, laughed good-naturedly. Noting my look of surprise and disappointment at not receiving a more concrete response, the Dalai Lama said, \u201cSometimes it\u2019s very difficult to explain why people do the things they do ."}, {"text": ".. You\u2019ll often find that there are no simple explanations. If we were to go into the details of individual lives, since a human being\u2019s mind is so complex, it would be quite difficult to understand what is going on, what exactly is taking place.\u201d I thought that he was being evasive. \u201cBut as a psychotherapist, my task is to find out why people do the things that they do ."}, {"text": "..\u201d Once again, he broke into the laugh that many people find so extraordinary\u2014a laugh saturated  \fwith humor and goodwill, unaffected, unembarrassed, beginning with a deep resonance and effortlessly climbing several octaves to end in a high pitch of delight. \u201cI think that it would be extremely difficult to try and figure out how the minds of five billion people work,\u201d he said, still laughing."}, {"text": " \u201cIt would be an impossible task! From the Buddhist viewpoint, there are many factors contributing to any given event or situation ... There can be so many factors at play, in fact, that sometimes you may never have a full explanation of what\u2019s going on, at least not in conventional terms.\u201d Sensing some discomfort on my part, he observed, \u201cIn trying to determine the source of one\u2019s problems, it seems that the Western approach differs in some respects from the Buddhist approach."}, {"text": " Underlying all Western  \fmodes of analysis is a very strong rationalistic tendency\u2014an assumption that everything can be accounted for. And on top of that, there are constraints created by certain premises that are taken for granted. For example, recently I met with some doctors at a university medical school."}, {"text": " They were talking about the brain and stated that thoughts and feelings were the result of different chemical reactions and changes in the brain. So, I raised the question: Is it possible to conceive the reverse sequence, where the thought gives rise to the sequence of chemical events in the brain? However, the part that I found most interesting was the answer that the scientist gave."}, {"text": " He said, \u2018We start from the premise that all thoughts are products or functions of chemical reactions in the brain.\u2019 So it is simply a kind of rigidity, a decision not to challenge their own way of thinking.\u201d  \fHe was silent for a moment, then went on: \u201cI think that in modern Western society, there seems to be a powerful cultural conditioning that is based on science."}, {"text": " But in some instances, the basic premises and parameters set up by Western science can limit your ability to deal with certain realities. For instance, you have the constraints of the idea that everything can be explained within the framework of a single lifetime, and you combine this with the notion that everything can and must be explained and accounted for."}, {"text": " But when you encounter phenomena that you cannot account for, then there\u2019s a kind of a tension created; it\u2019s almost a feeling of agony.\u201d Even though I sensed there was truth in what he said, I found it difficult to accept at first. \u201cWell, in Western psychology when we come  \facross human behaviors that on the surface are difficult to explain, there are certain approaches that we can use to understand what\u2019s going on."}, {"text": " For example, the idea of the unconscious or subconscious part of the mind plays a prominent role. We feel that sometimes behavior can be a result of psychological processes that we aren\u2019t consciously aware of\u2014for instance, one might act in a certain way so as to avoid an underlying fear. Without being aware of it, certain behaviors may be motivated by the desire to not allow those fears to surface in the conscious mind, so we don\u2019t have to feel the discomfort associated with them."}, {"text": "\u201d Reflecting for a moment, the Dalai Lama said, \u201cIn Buddhism there is the idea of dispositions and imprints left by certain types of experiences, which is somewhat similar to the idea of the  \funconscious in Western psychology. For instance, a certain type of event may have occurred in an earlier part of your life which has left a very strong imprint on your mind which can remain hidden, and then later affect your behavior."}, {"text": " So, there is this idea of something that can be unconscious\u2014imprints that one may not be consciously aware of. Anyway, I think that Buddhism can accept many of the factors that the Western theorists can come up with, but on top of that it would add additional factors. For example, it would add the conditioning and imprints from previous lives."}, {"text": " In Western psychology, however, I think that there may be a tendency to overemphasize the role of the unconscious in looking for the source of one\u2019s problems. I think that this stems from some of the basic assumptions that Western psychology starts  \fwith: for instance, it does not accept the idea of imprints being carried over from a past life."}, {"text": " And at the same time there is an assumption that everything must be accounted for within this lifetime. So, when you can\u2019t explain what is causing certain behaviors or problems, the tendency is to always attribute it to the unconscious. It\u2019s a bit like you\u2019ve lost something and you decide that the object is in this room."}, {"text": " And once you have decided this, then you\u2019ve already fixed your parameters; you\u2019ve precluded the possibility of its being outside the room or in another room. So you keep on searching and searching, but you are not finding it, yet you continue to assume that it is still hidden somewhere in the room!\u201d  \fWhen I initially conceived of this book, I envisioned a conventional self-help format in which the Dalai Lama would present clear and simple solutions to all life\u2019s problems."}, {"text": " I felt that, using my background in psychiatry, I could codify his views in a set of easy instructions on how to conduct one\u2019s daily life. By the end of our series of meetings I had given up on that idea. I found that his approach encompassed a much broader and more complex paradigm, incorporating all the nuance, richness, and complexity that life has to offer."}, {"text": " Gradually, however, I began to hear the single note he constantly sounded. It is one of hope. His  \fhope is based on the belief that while attaining genuine and lasting happiness is not easy, it nevertheless can be done. Underlying all the Dalai Lama\u2019s methods there is a set of basic beliefs that act as a substrate for all his actions: a belief in the fundamental gentleness and goodness of all human beings, a belief in the value of compassion, a belief in a policy of kindness, and a sense of commonality among all living creatures."}, {"text": " As his message unfolded, it became increasingly clear that his beliefs are not based on blind faith or religious dogma but rather on sound reasoning and direct experience. His understanding of the human mind and behavior is based on a lifetime of study. His views are rooted in a tradition that dates back over twenty-five hundred years yet is tempered by common sense  \fand a sophisticated understanding of modern problems."}, {"text": " His appreciation of contemporary issues has been forged as a result of his unique position as a world figure, which has allowed him to travel the world many times, exposing himself to many different cultures and people from all walks of life, exchanging ideas with top scientists and religious and political leaders."}, {"text": " What ultimately emerges is a wise approach to dealing with human problems that is at once optimistic and realistic. In this book I have sought to present the Dalai Lama\u2019s approach to a primarily Western audience. I have included extensive excerpts from his public teachings and our private conversations."}, {"text": " In keeping with my purpose of trying to emphasize the material that is most readily applicable to our daily lives, I have at  \ftimes chosen to omit portions of the Dalai Lama\u2019s discussions that concern some of the more philosophical aspects of Tibetan Buddhism. The Dalai Lama has already written a number of excellent books on various aspects of the Buddhist path."}, {"text": " Selected titles can be found at the end of this book, and those interested in more indepth exploration of Tibetan Buddhism will find much of value in these books.  \fPart I  THE PURPOSE OF LIFE  \fChapter 1  THE RIGHT TO HAPPINESS  I believe that the very purpose of our life is to seek happiness. That is clear."}, {"text": " Whether one believes in religion or not, whether one believes in this religion or that religion, we all are seeking  \fsomething better in life. So, I think, the very motion of our life is towards happiness ...\u201c With these words, spoken before a large audience in Arizona, the Dalai Lama cut to the heart of his message."}, {"text": " But his claim that the purpose of life was happiness raised a question in my mind. Later, when we were alone, I asked, \u201cAre you happy?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d he said. He paused, then added, \u201cYes ... definitely.\u201d There was a quiet sincerity in his voice that left no doubt\u2014 a sincerity that was reflected in his expression and in his eyes."}, {"text": " \u201cBut is happiness a reasonable goal for most of us?\u201d I asked. \u201cIs it really possible?\u201d \u201cYes. I believe that happiness can be achieved through training the mind.\u201d On a basic human level, I couldn\u2019t help but respond to the idea of happiness as an achievable  \fgoal. As a psychiatrist, however, I had been burdened by notions such as Freud\u2019s belief that \u201cone feels inclined to say that the intention that man should be \u2018happy\u2019 is not included in the plan of \u2019Creation."}, {"text": "\u2018 \u201d This type of training had led many in my profession to the grim conclusion that the most one could hope for was \u201cthe transformation of hys teric misery into common unhappiness.\u201d From that standpoint, the claim that there was a clearly defined path to happiness seemed like quite a radical idea."}, {"text": " As I looked back over my years of psychiatric training, I could rarely recall having heard the word \u201chappiness\u201d even mentioned as a therapeutic objective. Of course, there was plenty of talk about relieving the patient\u2019s symptoms of depression or anxiety, of resolving internal conflicts or relationship problems, but never with  \fthe expressly stated goal of becoming happy."}, {"text": " The concept of achieving true happiness has, in the West, always seemed ill defined, elusive, ungraspable. Even the word \u201chappy\u201d is derived from the Icelandic word happ, meaning luck or chance. Most of us, it seems, share this view of the mysterious nature of happiness. In those moments of joy that life brings, happiness feels like something that comes out of the blue."}, {"text": " To my Western mind, it didn\u2019t seem the sort of thing that one could develop, and sustain, simply by \u201ctraining the mind.\u201d When I raised that objection, the Dalai Lama was quick to explain. \u201cWhen I say \u2018training the mind,\u2019 in this context I\u2019m not referring to \u2018mind\u2019 merely as one\u2019s cognitive ability or intellect."}, {"text": " Rather, I\u2019m using the term in the sense of the Tibetan word Sem, which has a much broader  \fmeaning, closer to\u2019psyche\u2019 or \u2018spirit\u2019, it includes intellect and feeling, heart and mind. By bringing about a certain inner discipline, we can undergo a transformation of our attitude, our entire outlook and approach to living."}, {"text": " \u201cWhen we speak of this inner discipline, it can of course involve many things, many methods. But generally speaking, one begins by identifying those factors which lead to happiness and those factors which lead to suffering. Having done this, one then sets about gradually eliminating those factors which lead to suffering and cultivating those which lead to happiness."}, {"text": " That is the way.\u201d  The Dalai Lama claims to have found some  \fmeasure of personal happiness. And throughout the week he spent in Arizona, I often witnessed how this personal happiness can manifest as a simple willingness to reach out to others, to create a feeling of affinity and goodwill, even in the briefest of encounters."}, {"text": " One morning after his public lecture the Dalai Lama was walking along an outside patio on the way back to his hotel room, surrounded by his usual retinue. Noticing one of the hotel housekeeping staff standing by the elevators, he paused to ask her, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d For a moment she appeared taken aback by this foreign-looking man in the maroon robes and seemed puzzled by the deference of the entourage."}, {"text": " Then she smiled and answered shyly, \u201cMexico.\u201d He paused briefly to chat with her a few moments and then walked on, leaving her  \fwith a look of excitement and pleasure on her face. The next morning at the same time, she appeared at the same spot with another of the housekeeping staff, and the two of them greeted him warmly as he got into the elevator."}, {"text": " The interaction was brief, but the two of them appeared flushed with happiness as they returned to work. Every day after that, they were joined by a few more of the housekeeping staff at the designated time and place, until by the end of the week there were dozens of maids in their crisp gray-and-white uniforms forming a receiving line that stretched along the length of the path that led to the elevators."}, {"text": "  \fOur days are numbered. At this very moment, many thousands are born into the world, some destined to live only a few days or weeks, and then tragically succumb to illness or other misfortune. Others are destined to push through to the century mark, perhaps even a bit beyond, and savor every taste life has to offer: triumph, despair, joy, hatred, and love."}, {"text": " We never know. But whether we live a day or a century, a central question always remains: What is the purpose of our life? What makes our lives meaningful? The purpose of our existence is to seek happiness. It seems like common sense, and Western thinkers from Aristotle to William James have agreed with this idea."}, {"text": " But isn\u2019t a life based on seeking personal happiness by nature selfcentered, even self-indulgent? Not necessarily. In fact, survey after survey has shown that it is  \funhappy people who tend to be most selffocused and are often socially withdrawn, brooding, and even antagonistic. Happy people, in contrast, are generally found to be more sociable, flexible, and creative and are able to tolerate life\u2019s daily frustrations more easily than unhappy people."}, {"text": " And, most important, they are found to be more loving and forgiving than unhappy people. Researchers have devised some interesting experiments demonstrating that happy people exhibit a certain quality of openness, a willingness to reach out and help others. They managed, for instance, to induce a happy mood in a test subject by arranging to have the person unexpectedly find money in a phone booth."}, {"text": " Posing as a stranger, one of the experimenters then walked by and \u201caccidentally\u201d dropped a  \fload of papers. The investigators wanted to see whether the subject would stop to help the stranger. In another scenario, the subjects\u2019 spirits were lifted by listening to a comedy album, and then they were approached by someone in need (also in cahoots with the experi menter) wanting to borrow money."}, {"text": " The investigators discovered that the subjects who were feeling happy were more likely to help someone or to lend money than another \u201ccontrol group\u201d of individuals who were presented with the same opportunity to help but whose mood had not been boosted ahead of time. While these kinds of experiments contradict the notion that the pursuit and achievement of personal happiness somehow lead to selfishness and self-absorption, we can all conduct our own experiment in the laboratory of our own daily  \flives."}, {"text": " Suppose, for instance, we\u2019re stuck in traffic. After twenty minutes it finally begins moving again, at around parade speed. We see someone in another car signaling that she wants to pull into our lane ahead of us. If we\u2019re in a good mood, we are more likely to slow down and wave them on ahead. If we\u2019re feeling miserable, our response may be simply to speed up and close the gap."}, {"text": " \u201cWell, I\u2019ve been stuck here waiting all this time; why shouldn\u2019t they?\u201d We begin, then, with the basic premise that the purpose of our life is to seek happiness. It is a vision of happiness as a real objective, one that we can take positive steps toward achieving. And as we begin to identify the factors that lead to a happier life, we will learn how the search for happiness offers benefits not only for the individual but for the individual\u2019s family and for  \fsociety at large as well."}, {"text": "  \fChapter 2  THE SOURCES OF HAPPINESS  Two years ago, a friend of mine had an unexpected windfall. Eighteen months before that time, she had quit her job as a nurse to go to work for two friends who were starting a small  \fhealth-care company.

I mean things are different\u2014I bought a new house and stuff\u2014but overall I don\u2019t think I\u2019m much happier than I was before.\u201d Just around the time that my friend was cashing in on her windfall profits, I had another  \ffriend of the same age who found out he was HIV positive."}, {"text": " We spoke about how he was dealing with his HIV status. \u201cOf course, I was devastated at first,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it took me almost a year just to come to terms with the fact that I had the virus. But over the past year things have changed. I seem to get more out of each day than I ever did before, and on a moment-tomoment basis, I feel happier than I ever have."}, {"text": " I just seem to appreciate everyday things more, and I\u2019m grateful that so far I haven\u2019t developed any severe AIDS symptoms and I can really enjoy the things I have. And even though I\u2019d rather not be HIV positive, I have to admit that in some ways it has transformed my life ... in positive ways ."}, {"text": "..\u201d \u201cIn what ways?\u201d I asked. \u201cWell, for instance, you know that I\u2019ve  \falways tended to be a confirmed materialist.

I\u2019ve started exploring spirituality for the first time in my life, reading a lot of books on the subject and talking to people ."}, {"text": ".. discovering so many things that I\u2019ve never even thought about before. It makes me excited about just getting up in the morning, about seeing what the day will bring.\u201d Both these people illustrate the essential point that happiness is determined more by one\u2019s state of mind than by external events."}, {"text": " Success may result in a temporary feeling of elation, or tragedy may send us into a period of depression, but sooner or later our overall level of happiness tends to migrate back to a certain baseline. Psychologists call this process adaptation, and we can see how this principle operates in our  \feveryday life; a pay raise, a new car, or recognition from our peers may lift our mood for a while, but we soon return to our customary level of happiness."}, {"text": " In the same way, an argument with a friend, a car in the repair shop, or a minor injury may put us in a foul mood, but within a matter of days our spirits rebound. This tendency isn\u2019t limited to trivial, everyday events but persists even under more extreme conditions of triumph or disaster. Researchers surveying Illinois state lottery winners and British pool winners, for instance, found that the initial high eventually wore off and the winners returned to their usual range of moment-to-moment happiness."}, {"text": " And other studies have demonstrated that even those who are struck by catastrophic events such as cancer, blindness, or paralysis typically recover their normal or near-normal  \flevel of day-to-day happiness after an appropriate adjustment period. So, if we tend to return to our characteristic baseline level of happiness no matter what our external conditions are, what determines this baseline? And, more important, can it be modified, set at a higher level? Some researchers have recently argued that an individual\u2019s characteristic level of happiness or well-being is genetically determined, at least to some degree."}, {"text": " Studies such as one that found that identical twins (sharing the same genetic constitution) tend to have very similar levels of well-being\u2014regardless of whether they were raised together or apart\u2014 have led these investigators to postulate a biological set point for happiness, wired into the brain at birth."}, {"text": " But even if genetic makeup plays a role in  \fhappiness\u2014and the verdict is still out on how large that role is\u2014there is general agreement among psychologists that no matter what level of happiness we are endowed with by nature, there are steps we can take to work with the \u201cmind factor,\u201d to enhance our feelings of happiness."}, {"text": " This is because our moment-to-moment happiness is largely determined by our outlook. In fact, whether we are feeling happy or unhappy at any given moment often has very little to do with our absolute conditions but, rather it is a function of how we perceive our situation, how satisfied we are with what we have."}, {"text": "  \fTHE COMPARING MIND  What shapes our perception and level of satisfaction? Our feelings of contentment are strongly influenced by our tendency to compare. When we compare our current situation to our past and find that we\u2019re better off, we feel happy. This happens, for instance, when our income suddenly jumps from $20,000 to $30,000 a year, but it\u2019s not the absolute amount of income that makes us happy, as we soon find out when we get used to our new income and discover that we won\u2019t be happy again unless we\u2019re making $40,000 a year."}, {"text": " We also look around and compare ourselves to others. No matter how much we make, we tend  \fto be dissatisfied with our income if our neighbor is making more. Professional athletes complain bitterly about annual salaries of $1 million, $2 million, or $3 million, citing the higher salary of a teammate as justification for their unhappiness."}, {"text": " This tendency seems to support H. L. Mencken\u2019s definition of a wealthy man: one whose income is $100 a year higher than his wife\u2019s sister\u2019s husband. So we can see how our feeling of life satisfaction often depends on who we compare ourselves to. Of course, we compare other things besides income."}, {"text": " Constant comparison with those who are smarter, more beautiful, or more successful than ourselves also tends to breed envy, frustration, and unhappiness. But we can use this same principle in a positive way; we can increase our feeling of life satisfaction by  \fcomparing ourselves to those who are less fortunate than us and by reflecting on all the things we have."}, {"text": " Researchers have conducted a number of experiments demonstrating that one\u2019s level of life satisfaction can be enhanced simply by shifting one\u2019s perspective and contemplating how things could be worse. In one study, women at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee were shown images of the extremely harsh living conditions in Milwaukee at the turn of the century or were asked to visualize and write about going through personal tragedies such as being burned or disfigured."}, {"text": " After completing this exercise, the women were asked to rate the quality of their own lives. The exercise resulted in an increased sense of satisfaction with their lives. In another experiment at the State University of New York  \fat Buffalo, subjects were asked to complete the sentence \u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m not a ."}, {"text": "..\u201d After five repetitions of this exercise, the subjects experienced a distinct elevation in their feelings of life satisfaction. Another group of subjects was asked by the experimenters to complete the sentence \u201cI wish I were a ...\u201d This time, the experiment left the subjects feeling more dissatisfied with their lives."}, {"text": " These experiments, which show that we can increase or decrease our sense of life satisfaction by changing our perspective, clearly point to the supremacy of one\u2019s mental outlook in living a happy life. The Dalai Lama explains, \u201cAlthough it is possible to achieve happiness, happiness is not a simple thing."}, {"text": " There are many levels. In Buddhism, for instance, there is a reference to the four  \ffactors of fulfillment, or happiness: wealth, worldly satisfaction, spirituality, and enlightenment. Together they embrace the totality of an individual\u2019s quest for happiness. \u201cLet us leave aside for a moment ultimate religious or spiritual aspirations like perfection and enlightenment and deal with joy and happiness as we understand them in an everyday or worldly sense."}, {"text": " Within this context, there are certain key elements that we conventionally acknowledge as contributing to joy and happiness. For example, good health is considered to be one of the necessary factors for a happy life. Another factor that we regard as a source of happiness is our material facilities, or the wealth that we accumulate."}, {"text": " An additional factor is to have friendship, or companions. We all recognize that in order to enjoy a fulfilled life,  \fwe need a circle of friends with whom we can relate emotionally and trust. \u201cNow, all of these factors are, in fact, sources of happiness. But in order for an individual to be able to fully utilize them towards the goal of enjoying a happy and fulfilled life, your state of mind is key."}, {"text": " It\u2019s crucial. \u201cIf we utilize our favorable circumstances, such as our good health or wealth, in positive ways, in helping others, they can be contributory factors in achieving a happier life. And of course we enjoy these things\u2014our material facilities, success, and so on. But without the right mental attitude, without attention to the mental factor, these things have very little impact on our longterm feelings of happiness."}, {"text": " For example, if you harbor hateful thoughts or intense anger somewhere deep down within yourself, then it  \fruins your health; thus it destroys one of the factors. Also, if you are mentally unhappy or frustrated, then physical comfort is not of much help. On the other hand, if you can maintain a calm, peaceful state of mind, then you can be a very happy person even if you have poor health."}, {"text": " Or, even if you have wonderful possessions, when you are in an intense moment of anger or hatred, you feel like throwing them, breaking them. At that moment your possessions mean nothing. Today there are societies that are very developed materially, yet among them there are many people who are not very happy."}, {"text": " Just underneath the beautiful surface of affluence there is a kind of mental unrest, leading to frustration, unnecessary quarrels, reliance on drugs or alcohol, and in the worst case, suicide. So there is no guarantee that wealth alone can give you the  \fjoy or fulfillment that you are seeking. The same can be said of your friends too."}, {"text": " When you are in an intense state of anger or hatred, even a very close friend appears to you as somehow sort of frosty, or cold, distant, and quite annoying. \u201cAll of this indicates the tremendous influence that the mental state, the mind factor, has on our experience of daily life. Naturally, then, we have to take that factor very seriously."}, {"text": " \u201cSo leaving aside the perspective of spiritual practice, even in worldly terms, in terms of our enjoying a happy day-to-day existence, the greater the level of calmness of our mind, the greater our peace of mind, the greater our ability to enjoy a happy and joyful life.\u201d The Dalai Lama paused for a moment as if to let that idea settle, then added, \u201cI should mention that when we speak of a calm state of mind or  \fpeace of mind, we shouldn\u2019t confuse that with a totally insensitive, apathetic state of mind."}, {"text": " Having a calm or peaceful state of mind doesn\u2019t mean being totally spaced out or completely empty. Peace of mind or a calm state of mind is rooted in affection and compassion. There is a very high level of sensitivity and feeling there.\u201d Summarizing, he said, \u201cAs long as there is a lack of the inner discipline that brings calmness of mind, no matter what external facilities or conditions you have, they will never give you the feeling of joy and happiness that you are seeking."}, {"text": " On the other hand, if you possess this inner quality, a calmness of mind, a degree of stability within, then even if you lack various external facilities that you would normally consider necessary for happiness, it is still possible to live a happy and joyful life.\u201d  \fINNER CONTENTMENT  Crossing the hotel parking lot on my way to meet with the Dalai Lama one afternoon, I stopped to admire a brand-new Toyota Land Cruiser, the type of car I had been wanting for a long time."}, {"text": " Still thinking of that car as I began my session, I asked, \u201cSometimes it seems that our whole culture, Western culture, is based on material acquisition; we\u2019re surrounded, bombarded, with ads for the latest things to buy, the latest car and so on. It\u2019s difficult not to be influenced by that. There are so many things we want, things we desire."}, {"text": " It never seems to stop. Can you speak a bit about desire?\u201d \u201cI think there are two kinds of desire,\u201d the  \fDalai Lama replied. \u201cCertain desires are positive. A desire for happiness. It\u2019s absolutely right. The desire for peace. The desire for a more harmonious world, a friendlier world. Certain desires are very useful."}, {"text": " \u201cBut at some point, desires can become unreasonable. That usually leads to trouble. Now, for example, sometimes I visit supermarkets. I really love to see supermarkets, because I can see so many beautiful things. So, when I look at all these different articles, I develop a feeling of desire, and my initial impulse might be, \u2018Oh, I want this; I want that."}, {"text": "\u2019 Then, the second thought that arises, I ask myself, \u2018Oh, do I really need this?\u2019 The answer is usually no. If you follow after that first desire, that initial impulse, then very soon your pockets will empty. However, the other level of desire, based on  \fone\u2019s essential needs of food, clothing, and shelter, is something more reasonable."}, {"text": " \u201cSometimes, whether a desire is excessive or negative depends on the circumstances or society in which you live. For example, if you live in a prosperous society where a car is required to help you manage in your daily life, then of course there\u2019s nothing wrong in desiring a car. But if you live in a poor village in India where you can manage quite well without a car but you still desire one, even if you have the money to buy it, it can ultimately bring trouble."}, {"text": " It can create an uncomfortable feeling among your neighbors and so on. Or, if you\u2019re living in a more prosperous society and have a car but keep wanting more expensive cars, that leads to the same kind of problems.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d I argued, \u201cI can\u2019t see how wanting or  \fbuying a more expensive car leads to problems for an individual, as long as he or she can afford it."}, {"text": " Having a more expensive car than your neighbors might be a problem for them\u2014they might be jealous and so on\u2014but having a new car would give you, yourself, a feeling of satisfaction and enjoyment.\u201d The Dalai Lama shook his head and replied firmly, \u201cNo.... Self-satisfaction alone cannot determine if a desire or action is positive or negative."}, {"text": " A murderer may have a feeling of satisfaction at the time he is committing the murder, but that doesn\u2019t justify the act. All the nonvirtuous actions\u2014lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and so on\u2014are committed by people who may be feeling a sense of satisfaction at the time. The demarcation between a positive and a negative desire or action is not whether it  \fgives you a immediate feeling of satisfaction but whether it ultimately results in positive or negative consequences."}, {"text": " For example, in the case of wanting more expensive possessions, if that is based on a mental attitude that just wants more and more, then eventually you\u2019ll reach a limit of what you can get; you\u2019ll come up against reality. And when you reach that limit, then you\u2019ll lose all hope, sink down into depression, and so on."}, {"text": " That\u2019s one danger inherent in that type of desire. \u201cSo I think that this kind of excessive desire leads to greed\u2014an exaggerated form of desire, based on overexpectation. And when you reflect upon the excesses of greed, you\u2019ll find that it leads an individual to a feeling of frustration, disappointment, a lot of confusion, and a lot of problems."}, {"text": " When it comes to dealing with greed, one thing that is quite characteristic is that  \falthough it arrives by the desire to obtain something, it is not satisfied by obtaining. Therefore, it becomes sort of limitless, sort of bottomless, and that leads to trouble. One interesting thing about greed is that although the underlying motive is to seek satisfaction, the irony is that even after obtaining the object of your desire, you are still not satisfied."}, {"text": " The true antidote of greed is contentment. If you have a strong sense of contentment, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you obtain the object or not; either way, you are still content.\u201d  \fSo, how can we achieve inner contentment? There are two methods. One method is to obtain everything that we want and desire\u2014all the money, houses, and cars; the perfect mate; and the perfect body."}, {"text": " The Dalai Lama has already pointed out the disadvantage of this approach; if our wants and desires remain unchecked, sooner or later we will run up against something that we want but can\u2019t have. The second, and more reliable, method is not to have what we want but rather to want and appreciate what we have."}, {"text": " The other night, I was watching a television interview with Christopher Reeve, the actor who was thrown from a horse in 1994 and suffered a spinal cord injury that left him completely paralyzed from the neck down, requiring a mechanical ventilator even to breathe. When questioned by the interviewer about how he dealt  \fwith the depression resulting from his disability, Reeve revealed that he had experienced a brief period of complete despair while in the intensive care unit of the hospital."}, {"text": " He went on to say, however, that these feelings of despair passed relatively quickly, and he now sincerely considered himself to be a \u201clucky guy.\u201d He cited the blessings of a loving wife and children but also spoke gratefully about the rapid advances of modern medicine (which he estimates will find a cure for spinal cord injury within the next decade), stating that if he had been hurt just a few years earlier, he probably would have died from his injuries."}, {"text": " While describing the process of adjusting to his paralysis, Reeve said that while his feelings of despair resolved rather quickly, at first he was still troubled by intermittent pangs of jealousy that could be triggered by another\u2019s  \finnocent passing remark such as, \u201cI\u2019m just gonna run upstairs and get something."}, {"text": "\u201d In learning to deal with these feelings, he said, \u201cI realized that the only way to go through life is to look at your assets, to see what you can still do; in my case, fortunately I didn\u2019t have any brain injury, so I still have a mind I can use.\u201d Focusing on his resources in this manner, Reeve has elected to use his mind to increase awareness and educate the public about spinal cord injury, to help others, and has plans to continue speaking as well as to write and direct films."}, {"text": "  \fINNER WORTH  We\u2019ve seen how working on our mental outlook is a more effective means of achieving happiness than seeking it through external sources such as wealth, position, or even physical health. Another internal source of happiness, closely linked with an inner feeling of contentment, is a sense of selfworth."}, {"text": " In describing the most reliable basis for developing that sense of self-worth, the Dalai Lama explained: \u201cNow in my case, for instance, suppose I had no depth of human feeling, no capacity for easily creating good friends. Without that, when I lost my own country, when my political authority in Tibet came to an end, becoming a refugee would  \fhave been very difficult."}, {"text": " While I was in Tibet, because of the way the political system was set up, there was a certain degree of respect given to the office of the Dalai Lama and people related to me accordingly, regardless of whether they had true affection towards me or not. But if that was the only basis of people\u2019s relation towards me, then when I lost my country, it would have been extremely difficult."}, {"text": " But there is another source of worth and dignity from which you can relate to other fellow human beings. You can relate to them because you are still a human being, within the human community. You share that bond. And that human bond is enough to give rise to a sense of worth and dignity. That bond can become a source of consolation in the event that you lose everything else."}, {"text": "\u201d  \fThe Dalai Lama stopped for a moment to take a sip of tea, then shaking his head he added, \u201cUnfortunately, when you read history you\u2019ll find cases of emperors or kings in the past who lost their status due to some political upheaval and were forced to leave the country, but the story afterwards wasn\u2019t that positive for them."}, {"text": " I think without that feeling of affection and connection with other fellow human beings, life becomes very hard. \u201cGenerally speaking, you can have two different types of individuals. On the one hand, you can have a wealthy, successful person, surrounded by relatives and so on. If that person\u2019s source of dignity and sense of worth is only material, then so long as his fortune remains, maybe that person can sustain a sense of security."}, {"text": " But the moment the fortune wanes, the  \fperson will suffer because there is no other refuge. On the other hand, you can have another person enjoying similar economic status and financial success, but at the same time, that person is warm and affectionate and has a feeling of compassion. Because that person has another source of worth, another source that gives him or her a sense of dignity, another anchor, there is less chance of that person\u2019s becoming depressed if his or her fortune happens to disappear."}, {"text": " Through this type of reasoning you can see the very practical value of human warmth and affection in developing an inner sense of worth.\u201d  \fHAPPINESS VERSUS PLEASURE  Several months after the Dalai Lama\u2019s talks in Arizona, I visited him at his home in Dharamsala. It was a particularly hot and humid July afternoon, and I arrived at his home drenched in sweat after only a short hike from the village."}, {"text": " Coming from a dry climate, I found the humidity to be almost unbearable that day, and I wasn\u2019t in the best of moods as we sat down to begin our conversation. He, on the other hand, seemed to be in great spirits. Shortly into our conversation, we turned to the topic of pleasure. At one point in the discussion, he made a crucial observation: \u201cNow sometimes people confuse happiness with pleasure."}, {"text": " For example, not long ago I was  \fspeaking to an Indian audience at Rajpur. I mentioned that the purpose of life was happiness, so one member of the audience said that Rajneesh teaches that our happiest moment comes during sexual activity, so through sex one can become the happiest,\u201d the Dalai Lama laughed heartily."}, {"text": " \u201cHe wanted to know what I thought of that idea. I answered that from my point of view, the highest happiness is when one reaches the stage of Liberation, at which there is no more suffering. That\u2019s genuine, lasting happiness. True happiness relates more to the mind and heart. Happiness that depends mainly on physical pleasure is unstable; one day it\u2019s there, the next day it may not be."}, {"text": "\u201d  \fOn the surface, it seemed like a fairly obvious observation; of course, happiness and pleasure were two different things. And yet, we human beings are often quite adept at confusing the two. Not long after I returned home, during a therapy session with a patient, I was to have a concrete demonstration of just how powerful that simple realization can be."}, {"text": " Heather was a young single professional working as a coun selor in the Phoenix area. Although she enjoyed her job working with troubled youth, for some time she had become increasingly dissatisfied with living in that area. She often complained about the growing population, the traffic, and the oppressive heat in the summer."}, {"text": " She had been offered a job in a beautiful small town in the mountains. In fact, she  \fhad visited that town many times and had always dreamed of moving there. It was perfect. The only problem was the fact that the job she was offered involved an adult clientele. For weeks, she had been struggling with the decision whether to accept the new job."}, {"text": " She just couldn\u2019t make up her mind. She tried making up a list of pros and cons, but the list was annoyingly even. She explained, \u201cI know I wouldn\u2019t enjoy the work as much as my job here, but that would be more than compensated for by the pure pleasure of living in that town! I really love it there."}, {"text": " Just being there makes me feel good. And I\u2019m so sick of the heat here. I just don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Her mention of the term \u201cpleasure\u201d reminded me of the Dalai Lama\u2019s words, and, probing a bit, I asked, \u201cDo you think that moving there would bring you greater happiness or greater  \fpleasure?\u201d She paused for a moment, uncertain what to make of the question."}, {"text": " Finally she answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know ... You know, I think it would bring me more pleasure than happiness ... Ultimately, I don\u2019t think I\u2018dreally be happy working with that clientele. I really do get a lot of satisfaction working with the kids at my job....\u201d Simply reframing her dilemma in terms of \u201cWill it bring me happiness?\u201d seemed to provide a certain clarity."}, {"text": " Suddenly it became much easier to make her decision. She decided to remain in Phoenix. Of course, she still complained about the summer heat. But, having made the conscious decision to remain there on the basis of what she felt would ultimately make her happier, somehow made the heat more bearable."}, {"text": "  \fEveryday we are faced with numerous decisions and choices. And try as we may, we often don\u2019t choose the thing that we know is \u201cgood for us.\u201d Part of this is related to the fact that the \u201cright choice\u201d is often the difficult one\u2014the one that involves some sacrifice of our pleasure. In every century, men and women have struggled with trying to define the properrole that pleasure should play in their lives\u2014a legion of philosophers, theologists, and psychologists, all exploring our relationship with pleasure."}, {"text": " In the third century B.C., Epicurus based his system of ethics on the bold assertion that \u201cpleasure is the beginning and end of the blessed life.\u201d But even Epicurus acknowledged the importance of common sense and moderation, recognizing that  \funbridled devotion to sensual pleasures could sometimes lead to pain instead."}, {"text": " In the closing years of the nineteenth century, Sigmund Freud was busy formulating his own theories about pleasure. According to Freud, the fundamental motivating force for the entire psychic apparatus was the wish to relieve the tension caused by unfulfilled instinctual drives; in other words, our underlying motive is to seek pleasure."}, {"text": " In the twentieth century, many researchers have chosen to side-step more philosophical speculations, and, instead, a host of neuroanatomists have taken to poking around the brain\u2019s hypothalamus and limbic regions with electrodes, searching for the spot that produces pleasure when electrically stimulated."}, {"text": " None of us really need dead Greek philosophers, nineteenth-century psychoanalysts,  \for twentieth-century scientists to help us understand pleasure. We know it when we feel it. We know it in the touch or smile of a loved one, in the luxury of a hot bath on a cold rainy afternoon, in the beauty of a sunset."}, {"text": " But many of us also know pleasure in the frenetic rhapsody of a cocaine rush, the ecstasy of a heroin high, the revelry of an alcohol buzz, the bliss of unrestrained sexual excess, the exhilaration of a winning streak in Las Vegas. These are also very real pleasures\u2014pleasures that many in our society must come to terms with."}, {"text": " Although there are no easy solutions to avoiding these destructive pleasures, fortunately we have a place to begin: the simple reminder that what we are seeking in life is happiness. As the Dalai Lama points out, that is an unmistakable fact. If we approach our choices in life keeping  \fthat in mind, it is easier to give up the things that are ultimately harmful to us, even if those things bring us momentary pleasure."}, {"text": " The reason why it is usually so difficult to \u201cJust say no!\u201d is found in the word \u201cno\u201d; that approach is associated with a sense of rejecting something, of giving something up, of denying ourselves. But there is a better approach: framing any decision we face by asking ourselves, \u201cWill it bring me happiness?\u201d That simple question can be a powerful tool in helping us skillfully conduct all areas of our lives, not just in the decision whether to indulge in drugs or that third piece of banana cream pie."}, {"text": " It puts a new slant on things. Approaching our daily decisions and choices with this question in mind shifts the focus from what we are denying ourselves to what we are seeking \u2014ultimate happiness. A kind of happiness, as  \fdefined by the Dalai Lama, that is stable and persistent. A state of happiness that remains, despite life\u2019s ups and downs and normal fluctuations of mood, as part of the very matrix of our being."}, {"text": " With this perspective, it\u2019s easier to make the \u201cright decision\u201d because we are acting to give ourselves something, not denying or withholding something from ourselves\u2014an attitude of moving toward rather than moving away, an attitude of embracing life rather than rejecting it. This underlying sense of moving toward happiness can have a very profound effect; it makes us more receptive, more open, to the joy of living."}, {"text": "  \fChapter 3  TRAINING THE MIND FOR HAPPINESS  \fTHE PATH TO HAPPINESS  In identifying one\u2019s mental state as the prime factor in achieving happiness, of course that doesn\u2019t deny that our basic physical needs for food, clothing, and shelter must be met. But once these basic needs are met, the message is clear: we don\u2019t need more money, we don\u2019t need greater success or fame, we don\u2019t need the perfect body or even the perfect mate\u2014right now, at this very moment, we have a mind, which is all the basic equipment we need to achieve complete happiness."}, {"text": " In presenting his approach to working with the mind, the Dalai Lama began, \u201cWhen we refer to \u2018mind\u2019 or\u2019consciousness,\u2018 there are many  \fdifferent varieties. Just like external conditions or objects, some things are very useful, some are very harmful, and some are neutral. So when dealing with external matter, usually we first try to identify which of these different substances or chemicals are helpful, so we can take care to cultivate, increase, and use them."}, {"text": " And those substances which are harmful, we get rid of. So similarly, when we talk about mind, there are thousands of different thoughts or different\u2019minds. Among them, some are very helpful; those, we should take and nourish. Some are negative, very harmful; those, we should try to reduce. \u201cSo, the first step in seeking happiness is learning."}, {"text": " We first have to learn how negative emotions and behaviors are harmful to us and how positive emotions are helpful. And we must realize how these negative emotions are not only  \fvery bad and harmful to one personally but harmful to society and the future of the whole world as well. That kind of realization enhances our determination to face and overcome them."}, {"text": " And then, there is the realization of the beneficial aspects of the positive emotions and behaviors. Once we realize that, we become determined to cherish, develop, and increase those positive emotions no matter how difficult that is. There is a kind of spontaneous willingness from within. So through this process of learning, of analyzing which thoughts and emotions are beneficial and which are harmful, we gradually develop a firm determination to change, feeling, \u2018Now the secret to my own happiness, my own good future, is within my own hands."}, {"text": " I must not miss that opportunity!\u2019 \u201cIn Buddhism, the principle of causality is  \faccepted as a natural law. In dealing with reality, you have to take that law into account. So, for instance, in the case of everyday experiences, if there are certain types of events that you do not desire, then the best method of ensuring that that event does not take place is to make sure that the causal conditions that normally give rise to that event no longer arise."}, {"text": " Similarly, if you want a particular event or experience to occur, then the logical thing to do is to seek and accumulate the causes and conditions that give rise to it. \u201cThis is also the case with mental states and experiences. If you desire happiness, you should seek the causes that give rise to it, and if you don\u2019t desire suffering, then what you should do is to ensure that the causes and conditions that would give rise to it no longer arise."}, {"text": " An appreciation of this causal principle is very  \fimportant. \u201cNow, we have spoken of the supreme importance of the mental factor in achieving happiness. Our next task, therefore, is to examine the variety of mental states that we experience. We need to clearly identify different mental states and make a distinction, classifying them according to whether they lead to happiness or not."}, {"text": "\u201d \u201cCan you give some specific examples of different mental states and describe how you would classify them?\u201d I asked. The Dalai Lama explained, \u201cNow for instance, hatred, jealousy, anger, and so on are harmful. We consider them negative states of mind because they destroy our mental happiness; once you harbor feelings of hatred or ill feeling towards someone, once you yourself are filled by  \fhatred or negative emotions, then other people appear to you as also hostile."}, {"text": " So as a result there is more fear, greater inhibition and hesitation, and a sense of insecurity. These things develop, and also loneliness in the midst of a world perceived as hostile. All these negative feelings develop because of hatred. On the other hand, mental states such as kindness and compassion are definitely very positive."}, {"text": " They are very useful ...\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just curious,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cYou mention that there are thousands of different states of mind. What would be your definition of a psychologically healthy or well-adjusted person? We might use such a definition as a guideline in determining which mental states to cultivate and which ones to eliminate."}, {"text": "\u201d He laughed, then with his characteristic humility he responded, \u201cAs a psychiatrist, you  \fmight have a better definition of a psychologically healthy person.\u201d \u201cBut I mean from your standpoint.\u201d \u201cWell, I would regard a compassionate, warm, kindhearted person as healthy. If you maintain a feeling of compassion, loving kindness, then something automatically opens your inner door."}, {"text": " Through that, you can communicate much more easily with other people. And that feeling of warmth creates a kind of openness. You\u2019ll find that all human beings are just like you, so you\u2019ll be able to relate to them more easily. That gives you a spirit of friendship. Then there\u2019s less need to hide things, and as a result, feelings of fear, self-doubt, and insecurity are automatically dispelled."}, {"text": " Also, it creates a feeling of trust from other people. Otherwise, for example, you might find someone  \fwho is very competent, and you know that you can trust that person\u2019s competence. But if you sense that person is not kind, then you have to hold something back. You feel that\u2018Oh, I know that person can do things, but can I really trust him?\u2019 so you will always have a certain apprehension which creates a kind of distance from him."}, {"text": " \u201cSo, anyway, I think that cultivating positive mental states like kindness and compassion definitely leads to better psychological health and happiness.\u201d  \fMENTAL DISCIPLINE  As he spoke, I found something very appealing about the Dalai Lama\u2019s approach to achieving happiness. It was absolutely practical and rational: Identify and cultivate positive mental states; identify and eliminate negative mental states."}, {"text": " Although his suggestion to begin by systematically analyzing the variety of mental states that we experience initially struck me as being a bit dry, I gradually became carried away by the force of his logic and reasoning. And I liked the fact that rather than classifying mental states, emotions, or desires on the basis of some externally imposed moral judgment such as  \f\u201cGreed is a sin\u201d or \u201cHatred is evil,\u201d he categorizes emotions as positive or negative simply on the basis of whether they lead to our ultimate happiness."}, {"text": " Resuming our conversation the next afternoon, I asked, \u201cIf happiness is simply a matter of cultivating more positive mental states like kindness and so on, why are so many people unhappy?\u201d \u201cAchieving genuine happiness may require bringing about a transformation in your outlook, your way of thinking, and this is not a simple matter,\u201d he said."}, {"text": " \u201cIt requires the application of so many different factors from different directions. You shouldn\u2019t have the notion, for instance, that there is just one key, a secret, and if you can get that right, then everything will be okay. It is similar to taking proper care of the physical  \fbody; you need a variety of vitamins and nutrients, not just one or two."}, {"text": " In the same way, in order to achieve happiness, you need a variety of approaches and methods to deal with and overcome the varied and complex negative mental states. And if you are seeking to overcome certain negative ways of thinking, it is not possible to accomplish that simply by adopting a particular thought or practicing a technique once or twice."}, {"text": " Change takes time. Even physical change takes time. For instance, if you\u2019re moving from one climate to another, the body needs time to adapt to the new environment. And in the same way, transforming your mind takes time. There are a lot of negative mental traits, so you need to address and counteract each one of these."}, {"text": " That isn\u2019t easy. It requires the repeated application of various  \ftechniques and taking the time to familiarize yourself with the practices. It\u2019s a process of learning. \u201cBut I think that as time goes on, you can make positive changes. Everyday as soon as you get up, you can develop a sincere positive motivation, thinking, \u2018I will utilize this day in a more positive way."}, {"text": " I should not waste this very day.\u2019 And then, at night before bed, check what you\u2019ve done, asking yourself, \u2018Did I utilize this day as I planned?\u2019 If it went accordingly, then you should rejoice. If it went wrong, then regret what you did and critique the day. So, through methods such as this, you can gradually strengthen the positive aspects of the mind."}, {"text": " \u201cNow, for example, in my own case, as a Buddhist monk, I believe in Buddhism and through my own experience I know that these  \fBuddhist practices are very helpful to me. However, because of habituation, through many previous lifetimes, certain things may arise, like anger or attachment. So now what I do is: first learn about the positive value of the practices, then build up determination, and then try to implement them."}, {"text": " At the beginning, the implementation of the positive practices is very small, so the negative influences are still very powerful. However, eventually, as you gradually build up the positive practices, the negative behaviors are automatically diminished. So, actually the practice of Dharma1 is a constant battle within, replacing previous negative conditioning or habituation with new positive conditioning."}, {"text": "\u201d Continuing he said, \u201cNo matter what activity or practice we are pursuing, there isn\u2019t anything  \fthat isn\u2019t made easier through constant familiarity and training. Through training, we can change; we can transform ourselves. Within Buddhist practice there are various methods of trying to sustain a calm mind when some disturbing event happens."}, {"text": " Through repeated practice of these methods we can get to the point where some disturbance may occur but the negative effects on our mind remain on the surface, like the waves that may ripple on the surface of an ocean but don\u2019t have much effect deep down. And, although my own experience may be very little, I have found this to be true in my own small practice."}, {"text": " So, if I receive some tragic news, at that moment I may experience some disturbance within my mind, but it goes very quickly. Or, I may become irritated and develop some anger, but again, it dissipates very quickly. There is no  \feffect on the deeper mind. No hatred. This was achieved through gradual practice; it didn\u2019t happen overnight."}, {"text": "\u201c Certainly not. The Dalai Lama has been engaged in training his mind since he was four years old.  The systematic training of the mind\u2014the cultivation of happiness, the genuine inner transformation by deliberately selecting and focusing on positive mental states and challenging negative mental states\u2014is possible because of the very structure and function of the brain."}, {"text": " We are born with brains that are genetically hardwired with certain instinctual behavior  \fpatterns; we are predisposed mentally, emotionally, and physically to respond to our environment in ways that enable us to survive. These basic sets of instructions are encoded in countless innate nerve cell activation patterns, specific combinations of brain cells that fire in response to any given event, experience, or thought."}, {"text": " But the wiring in our brains is not static, not irrevocably fixed. Our brains are also adaptable. Neuroscientists have documented the fact that the brain can design new patterns, new combinations of nerve cells and neurotransmitters (chemicals that transmit messages between nerve cells) in response to new input."}, {"text": " In fact, our brains are malleable, ever changing, reconfiguring their wiring according to new thoughts and experiences. And as a result of learning, the function of individual neurons themselves change,  \fallowing electrical signals to travel along them more readily. Scientists call the brain\u2019s inherent capacity to change \u201cplasticity."}, {"text": "\u201d This ability to change the brain\u2019s wiring, to grow new neural connections, has been demonstrated in experiments such as one conducted by Doctors Avi Karni and Leslie Underleider at the National Institutes of Mental Health. In that experiment, the researchers had subjects perform a simple motor task, a fingertapping exercise, and identified the parts of the brain involved in the task by taking a MRI brain scan."}, {"text": " The subjects then practiced the finger exercise daily for four weeks, gradually becoming more efficient and quicker at it. At the end of the four-week period, the brain scan was repeated and showed that the area of the brain involved in the task had expanded; this indicated that the  \fregular practice and repetition of the task had recruited new nerve cells and changed the neural connections that had originally been involved in the task."}, {"text": " This remarkable feature of the brain appears to be the physiological basis for the possibility of transforming our minds. By mobilizing our thoughts and practicing new ways of thinking, we can reshape our nerve cells and change the way our brains work. It is also the basis for the idea that inner transformation begins with learning (new input) and involves the discipline of gradually replacing our \u201cnegative conditioning\u201d (corresponding with our present characteristic nerve cell activation patterns) with \u201cpositive conditioning\u201d (forming new neural circuits)."}, {"text": " Thus, the idea of training the mind for happiness becomes a very real possibility.  \fETHICAL DISCIPLINE  In a later discussion related to training the mind for happiness, the Dalai Lama pointed out, \u201cI think that ethical behavior is another feature of the kind of inner discipline that leads to a happier existence."}, {"text": " One could call this ethical discipline. Great spiritual teachers like the Buddha advise us to perform wholesome actions and avoid indulging in unwholesome actions. Whether our action is wholesome or unwholesome depends on whether that action or deed arises from a disciplined or undisciplined state of mind."}, {"text": " It is felt that a disciplined mind leads to happiness and an undisciplined mind leads to suffering, and in fact it is said that bringing about discipline within  \fone\u2019s mind is the essence of the Buddha\u2019s teaching. \u201cWhen I speak of discipline, I\u2019m referring to self-discipline, not discipline that\u2019s externally imposed on you by someone else."}, {"text": " Also, I\u2019m referring to discipline that\u2019s applied in order to overcome your negative qualities. A criminal gang may need discipline to perform a successful robbery, but that discipline is useless.\u201d The Dalai Lama stopped speaking for a moment and seemed to be reflecting, gathering his thoughts."}, {"text": " Or, perhaps he was simply searching for a word in English. I don\u2019t know. But thinking about our conversation as he paused that afternoon, something about all this talk concerning the importance of learning and discipline began to strike me as being rather tedious when contrasted with the lofty goals of  \ftrue happiness, spiritual growth, and complete internal transformation."}, {"text": " It seemed that the quest for happiness should somehow be a more spontaneous process. Raising this issue, I interjected, \u201cYou describe the negative emotions and behaviors as being \u2018unwholesome\u2019 and the positive behaviors as \u2019wholesome.\u2018 Further, you\u2019ve said that an untrained or undisciplined mind generally results in negative or unwholesome behaviors, so we have to learn and train ourselves to increase our positive behaviors."}, {"text": " So far, so good. \u201cBut the thing that bothers me is that your very definition of negative or unwholesome behaviors is those behaviors which lead to suffering. And you define a wholesome behavior as one that leads to happiness. You also start with the basic premise that all beings naturally  \fwant to avoid suffering and gain happiness\u2014that desire is innate; it doesn\u2019t have to be learned."}, {"text": " The question then is: If it\u2019s natural for us to want to avoid suffering, why aren\u2019t we spontaneously and naturally more and more repulsed by the negative or unwholesome behaviors as we grow older? And if it is natural to want to gain happiness, why aren\u2019t we spontaneously and naturally more and more drawn to wholesome behaviors and thus become happier as our life progresses? I mean, if these wholesome behaviors naturally lead to happiness and we want happiness, shouldn\u2019t that occur as a natural process? Why should we need so much education, training, and discipline for that process to occur?\u201d Shaking his head, the Dalai Lama replied, \u201cEven in conventional terms, in our everyday life,  \fwe consider education as a very important factor for ensuring a successful and happy life."}, {"text": " And knowledge does not come by naturally. We have to train; we have to go through a kind of systematic training program and so forth. And we consider this conventional education and training to be quite hard; otherwise why would students look forward so much to vacations? Still, we know that this type of education is quite vital for ensuring a happy and successful life."}, {"text": " \u201cIn the same way, doing wholesome deeds may not come naturally, but we have to consciously train towards it. This is so, particularly in modern society, because there is a tendency to accept that the question of wholesome deeds and unwholesome deeds\u2014 what to do and what is not to be done\u2014is something that is considered to be within the  \fpurview of religion."}, {"text": " Traditionally, it has been considered the responsibility of religion to prescribe what behaviors are wholesome and what are not. However, in today\u2019s society, religion has lost its prestige and influence to some degree. And at the same time, no alternative, such as a secular ethics, has come up to replace it."}, {"text": " So there seems to be less attention paid to the need to lead a wholesome way of life. It is because of this that I think we need to make some special effort and consciously work towards gaining that kind of knowledge. For example, although I personally believe that our human nature is fundamentally gentle and compassionate, I feel it is not enough that this is our underlying nature; we must also develop an appreciation and awareness of that fact."}, {"text": " And changing how we perceive ourselves, through  \flearning and understanding, can have a very real impact on bow we interact with others and how we conduct our daily lives.\u201d Playing devil\u2019s advocate, I countered, \u201cStill, you use the analogy of conventional academic education and training. That is one thing."}, {"text": " But if you are talking about certain behaviors that you call \u2018wholesome\u2019 or positive, leading to happiness, and other behaviors leading to suffering, why does it take so much learning to identify which behaviors are which and so much training to implement the positive behaviors and eliminate the negative? I mean, if you put your hand in a fire, you get burned."}, {"text": " You pull your hand back, and you\u2019ve learned that this behavior leads to suffering. You don\u2019t need extensive learning or training to learn not to touch the fire again.  \f\u201cSo, why aren\u2019t all behaviors or emotions that lead to suffering like that? For instance, you claim that anger and hatred are clearly negative emotions and ultimately lead to suffering."}, {"text": " But why does one have to be educated about the harmful effects of anger and hatred in order to eliminate them? Since anger immediately causes an uncomfortable emotional state in oneself, and it is certainly easy to feel that discomfort directly, why doesn\u2019t one just naturally and spontaneously avoid it in the future?\u201d As the Dalai Lama listened intently to my arguments, his intelligent eyes widened slightly, as if he were mildly surprised, or even amused, at the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of my questions."}, {"text": " Then, with a hardy laugh, full of goodwill, he said: \u201cWhen you talk of knowledge leading to freedom or resolution of a problem, you have to  \funderstand that there are many different levels. For example, let\u2019s say that human beings in the Stone Age didn\u2019t know how to cook meat but they still had the biological need to eat, so they just ate like a wild animal."}, {"text": " As humans progressed, they learned how to cook and then how to put in different spices to make the food more tasty and then they came up with more diverse dishes. And even up to our present age, if we are suffering from a particular illness and through our knowledge we learn that a certain type of food is not good for us, even though we might have the desire to eat it, we restrain ourselves from eating it."}, {"text": " So it is clear that the more sophisticated the level of our knowledge is, the more effective we will be in dealing with the natural world. \u201cYou also need the ability to judge the long-  \fterm and short-term consequences of your behaviors and weigh the two. For example, in overcoming anger, although animals may experience anger, they cannot understand that anger is destructive."}, {"text": " In the case of human beings, however, there is a different level, where you have a kind of self-awareness that allows you to reflect and observe that when anger arises, it hurts you. Therefore, you can make a judgment that anger is destructive. You need to be able to make that inference. So it\u2019s not as simple as putting your hand in a fire, and then being burned and just learning in the future never to do it again."}, {"text": " The more sophisticated your level of education and knowledge about what leads to happiness and what causes suffering, the more effective you will be in achieving happiness. So, it is because of this that I think education and knowledge are  \fcrucial.\u201d Sensing, I suppose, my continued resistance to the idea of simple education as a means of internal transformation, he observed, \u201cOne problem with our current society is that we have an attitude towards education as if it is there to simply make you more clever, make you more ingenious."}, {"text": " Sometimes it even seems as if those who are not highly educated, those who are less sophisticated in terms of their educational training, are more innocent and more honest. Even though our society does not emphasize this, the most important use of knowledge and education is to help us understand the importance of engaging in more wholesome actions and bringing about discipline within our minds."}, {"text": " The proper utilization of our intelligence and knowledge is to effect changes from within to  \fdevelop a good heart.\u201d  \fChapter 4  RECLAIMING OUR INNATE STATE OF HAPPINESS  \fOUR FUNDAMENTAL NATURE  Now, we are made to seek happiness. And it is clear that feel-Nings of love, affection, closeness, and compassion bring happiness."}, {"text": " I believe that every one of us has the basis to be happy, to access the warm and compassionate states of mind that bring happiness,\u201c the Dalai Lama asserted. \u201dIn fact, it is one of my fundamental beliefs that not only do we inherently possess the potential for compassion but I believe that the basic or underlying nature of human beings is gentleness."}, {"text": "\u201c \u201cWhat do you base that belief on?\u201d \u201cThe Buddhist doctrine of \u2018Buddha Nature\u2019 provides some grounds for the belief that the  \ffundamental nature of all sentient beings is essentially gentle and not aggressive.2 But one can adopt this view without having to resort to the Buddhist doctrine of\u2019Buddha Nature."}, {"text": "\u2018 There are also other grounds on which I base this belief. I think the subject of human affection or compassion isn\u2019t just a religious matter; it\u2019s an indispensable factor in one\u2019s day-to-day life. \u201cSo, first, if we look at the very pattern of our existence from an early age until our death, we can see the way in which we are fundamentally nurtured by other\u2019s affection."}, {"text": " It begins at birth. Our very first act after birth is to suck our mother\u2019s or someone else\u2019s milk. That is an act of affection, of compassion. Without that act, we cannot survive. That\u2019s clear. And that action cannot be fulfilled unless there is a mutual feeling of affection. From the child\u2019s side, if there is no  \ffeeling of affection, no bond, towards the person who is giving the milk, then the child may not suck the milk."}, {"text": " And without affection on the part of the mother or someone else, then the milk may not come freely. So that\u2019s the way of life. That\u2019s reality. \u201cThen, our physical structure seems to be more suited to feelings of love and compassion. We can see how a calm, affectionate, wholesome state of mind has beneficial effects on our health and physical well-being."}, {"text": " Conversely, feelings of frustration, fear, agitation, and anger can be destructive to our health. \u201cWe can also see that our emotional health is enhanced by feelings of affection. To understand this, we need only to reflect on how we feel when others show us warmth and affection. Or, observe how our own affectionate feelings or  \fattitudes automatically and naturally affect us from within, how they make us feel."}, {"text": " These gentler emotions and the positive behaviors that go with them lead to a happier family and community life. \u201cSo, I think that we can infer that our fundamental human nature is one of gentleness. And if this is the case, then it makes all the more sense to try to live a way of life that is more in accordance with this basic gentle nature of our being."}, {"text": "\u201d \u201cIf our essential nature is kind and compassionate,\u201d I asked, \u201cI\u2019m just wondering how you account for all the conflicts and aggressive behaviors that are all around us.\u201d The Dalai Lama nodded thoughtfully for a moment before replying, \u201cOf course we can\u2019t ignore the fact that conflicts and tensions do exist, not only within an individual mind but also within  \fthe family, when we interact with other people, and at the societal level, the national level, and the global level."}, {"text": " So, looking at this, some people conclude that human nature is basically aggressive. They may point to human history, suggesting that compared to other mammals\u2018, human behavior is much more aggressive. Or, they may claim, \u2019Yes, compassion is a part of our mind. But anger is also a part of our mind."}, {"text": " They are equally a part of our nature; both are more or less at the same level.\u2018 Nonetheless,\u201d he said firmly, leaning forward in his chair, straining with alertness, \u201cit is still my firm conviction that human nature is essentially compassionate, gentle. That is the predominant feature of human nature."}, {"text": " Anger, violence, and aggression may certainly arise, but I think it\u2019s on a secondary or more superficial level; in a sense,  \fthey arise when we are frustrated in our efforts to achieve love and affection. They are not part of our most basic, underlying nature. \u201cSo, although aggression can occur, I believe that these conflicts aren\u2019t necessarily because of human nature but rather a result of the human intellect\u2014unbalanced human intelligence, misuse of our intelligence, our imaginative faculty."}, {"text": " Now in looking at human evolution, I think that compared to some other animals\u2018, our physical body may have been very weak. But because of the development of human intelligence, we were able to use many instruments and discover many methods to conquer adverse environmental conditions. As human society and environmental conditions gradually became more complex, this required a greater and greater role of our intelligence and cognitive ability to meet the ever-  \fincreasing demands of this complex environment."}, {"text": " So, I believe that our underlying or fundamental nature is gentleness, and intelligence is a later development. And I think that if that human ability, that human intelligence, develops in an unbalanced way, without being properly counterbalanced with compassion, then it can become destructive. It can lead to disaster."}, {"text": " \u201cBut, I think it\u2019s important to recognize that if human conflicts are created by misuse of human intelligence, we can also utilize our intelligence to find ways and means to overcome these conflicts. When human intelligence and human goodness or affection are used together, all human actions become constructive."}, {"text": " When we combine a warm heart with knowledge and education, we can learn to respect other\u2019s views and other\u2019s rights. This becomes the basis of a spirit of  \freconciliation that can be used to overcome aggression and resolve our conflicts.\u201d The Dalai Lama paused and glanced at his watch. \u201cSo,\u201d he concluded, \u201cno matter how much violence or how many bad things we have to go through, I believe that the ultimate solution to our conflicts, both internal and external, lies in returning to our basic or underlying human nature, which is gentle and compassionate."}, {"text": "\u201d Looking again at his watch, he began to laugh in a friendly way. \u201cSo ... we\u2019ll stop here ... It\u2019s been a long day!\u201d He gathered up his shoes which he had slipped off during our conversation and retired to his room.  \fTHE QUESTION OF HUMAN NATURE  Over the past few decades, the Dalai Lama\u2019s view of the underlying compassionate nature of human beings seems to be slowly gaining ground in the West, although it has been a struggle."}, {"text": " The notion that human behavior is essentially egoistic, that fundamentally we are all out for ourselves, is deeply ingrained in Western thought. The idea that not only are we inherently selfish but also that aggression and hostility are part of basic human nature has dominated our culture for centuries."}, {"text": " Of course, historically there were plenty of people with the opposite view. For instance, in  \fthe mid-1700s David Hume wrote a lot about the \u201cnatural benevolence\u201d of human beings. And a century later, even Charles Darwin himself attributed an \u201cinstinct of sympathy\u201d to our species. But for some reason the more pessimistic view of humanity has taken root in our culture, at least since the seventeenth century, under the influence of philosophers like Thomas Hobbes, who had a pretty dark view of the human species."}, {"text": " He saw the human race as being violent, competitive, in continual conflict, and concerned only with self-interest. Hobbes, who was famous for discounting any notion of basic human kindness, was once caught giving money to a beggar on the street. When questioned about this generous impulse, he claimed, \u201cI\u2019m not doing this to help him."}, {"text": " I\u2019m just doing this to relieve my own distress at seeing the man\u2019s poverty.\u201d  \fSimilarly, in the earlier part of this century, the Spanish-born philosopher George Santayana wrote that generous, caring impulses, while they may exist, are generally weak, fleeting, and unstable in human nature but, \u201cdig a little beneath the surface and you\u2019ll find a ferocious, persistent, profoundly selfish man."}, {"text": "\u201d Unfortunately, Western science and psychology grabbed hold of ideas like that, then sanctioned, and even encouraged, this egoistic view. Beginning in the earliest days of modern scientific psychology, there was a general underlying assumption that all human motivation is ultimately egoistic, based purely on self-interest."}, {"text": " After implicitly accepting the premise of our essential selfishness, a number of very prominent scientists over the past hundred years have added to this a belief in the essential aggressive nature of humans. Freud claimed that, \u201cthe  \finclination to aggression is an original, selfsubsisting, instinctual disposition."}, {"text": "\u201d In the latter half of this century, two writers in particular, Robert Ardrey and Konrad Lorenz, looked at patterns of animal behavior in certain predator species and concluded that humans were basically predators as well, with an innate or instinctive drive to fight over territory. In recent years, however, the tide appears to be turning on this profoundly pessimistic view of humanity, coming closer to the Dalai Lama\u2019s view of our underlying nature as gentle and compassionate."}, {"text": " Over the past two or three decades, there have been literally hundreds of scientific studies indicating that aggression is not essentially innate and that violent behavior is influenced by a variety of biological, social, situational, and environmental factors. Perhaps  \fthe most comprehensive statement on the latest research was summarized in the 1986 Seville Statement on Violence that was drawn up and signed by twenty top scientists from around the world."}, {"text": " In that statement, they of course acknowledged that violent behavior does occur, but they categorically stated that it is scientifically incorrect to say that we have an inherited tendency to make war or act violently. That behavior is not genetically programmed into human nature. They said that even though we have the neural apparatus to act violently, that behavior isn\u2019t automatically activated."}, {"text": " There\u2019s nothing in our neurophysiology that compels us to act violently. In examining the subject of basic human nature, most researchers in the field currently feel that fundamentally we have the potential to develop into gentle, caring  \fpeople or violent, aggressive people; the impulse that gets emphasized is largely a matter of training."}, {"text": " Contemporary researchers have refuted not only the idea of humanity\u2019s innate aggression, but the idea that humans are innately selfish and egoistic has also come under attack. Investigators such as C. Daniel Batson or Nancy Eisenberg at Arizona State University have conducted numerous studies over the past few years that demonstrate that humans have a tendency toward altruistic behavior."}, {"text": " Some scientists, such as soci ologist Dr. Linda Wilson, seek to discover why this is so. She has theorized that altruism may be part of our basic survival instinct\u2014the very opposite to ideas of earlier thinkers who theorized that hostility and aggression were the hallmark of our survival instinct."}, {"text": " Looking at over  \fa hundred natural disasters, Dr. Wilson found a strong pattern of altruism among disaster victims, which seemed to be part of the recovery process. She found that working together to help each other tended to ward off later psychological problems that might have resulted from the trauma."}, {"text": " The tendency to closely bond with others, acting for the welfare of others as well as oneself, may be deeply rooted in human nature, forged in the remote past as those who bonded together and became part of a group had an increased chance of survival. This need to form close social ties persists up to the present day."}, {"text": " In studies, such as one conducted by Dr. Larry Scherwitz, examining the risk factors for coronary heart disease, it has been found that the people who were most self-focused (those who referred to  \fthemselves using the pronouns \u201cI,\u201d \u201cme,\u201d and \u201cmy\u201d most often in an interview) were more likely to develop coronary heart disease, even when other health-threatening behaviors were controlled."}, {"text": " Scientists are discovering that those who lack close social ties seem to suffer from poor health, higher levels of unhappiness, and a greater vulnerability to stress. Reaching out to help others may be as fundamental to our nature as communication. One could draw an analogy with the development of language which, like the capacity for compassion and altruism, is one of the magnificent features of the human race."}, {"text": " Particular areas of the brain are specifically devoted to the potential for language. If we are exposed to the correct environmental conditions, that is, a society that speaks, then those discreet areas of  \fthe brain begin to develop and mature and our capacity for language grows. In the same way, all humans may be endowed with the \u201cseed of compassion."}, {"text": "\u201d When exposed to the right conditions\u2014at home, in society at large, and later perhaps through our own pointed efforts\u2014that \u201cseed\u201d will flourish. With this idea in mind, researchers are now seeking to discover the optimal environmental conditions that will allow the seed of caring and compassion to ripen in children."}, {"text": " They have identified several factors: having parents who are able to regulate their own emotions, who model caring behavior, who set appropriate limits on the children\u2019s behavior, who communicate that a child is responsible for her or his own behavior, and who use reasoning to help direct the child\u2019s attention to affective or emotional states and the consequences of her or  \fhis behavior on others."}, {"text": "  Revising our basic assumptions about the underlying nature of human beings, from hostile to helpful, can open up new possibilities. If we begin by assuming the self-interest model of all human behavior, then an infant serves as a perfect example, as \u201cproof,\u201d of that theory. At birth, infants appear to be programmed with only one thing on their minds: the gratification of their own needs\u2014food, physical comfort, and so on."}, {"text": " But if we suspend that basic egoistic assumption, a whole new picture begins to emerge. We could just as easily say that an infant is born  \fprogrammed for only one thing: the capacity and Purpose of bringing pleasure and joy to others. By just observing a healthy infant, it would be hard to deny the underlying gentle nature of human beings."}, {"text": " And from this new vantage point, we could make a good case that the capacity to bring pleasure to another, the caregiver, is inborn. For example, in a newborn infant the sense of smell is developed to perhaps only 5 percent that of an adult, and the sense of taste is developed very little. But what does exist of these senses in the newborn is geared toward the smell and taste of breast milk."}, {"text": " The act of nursing not only provides nutrients for the baby; it also serves to relieve tension in the breast. So, we could say that the infant is born with an innate capacity to bring pleasure to the mother, by relieving the tension in the breast.  \fAn infant is also biologically programmed to recognize and respond to faces, and there are few people who fail to find genuine pleasure in having a young baby gazing innocently into their eyes and smile."}, {"text": " Some ethologists have formulated this into a theory, suggesting that when an infant smiles at the caregiver or looks directly into his eyes, the infant is following a deeply ingrained \u201cbiological blueprint,\u201d instinctively \u201creleasing\u201d gentle, tender, caring behaviors from the caregiver, who is also obeying an equally compelling instinctual mandate."}, {"text": " As more investigators strike out to objectively discover the nature of human beings, the notion of the infant as a little bundle of selfishness, an eating and sleeping machine, is yielding to a vision of a being that comes into the world with an innate mechanism to please others, requiring only the  \fproper environmental conditions to allow the underlying and natural \u201cseed of compassion\u201d to germinate and grow."}, {"text": " Once we conclude that the basic nature of humanity is compassionate rather than aggressive, our relationship to the world around us changes immediately. Seeing others as basically compassionate instead of hostile and selfish helps us relax, trust, live at ease. It makes us happier.  \fMEDITATION ON THE PURPOSE OF LIFE  As the Dalai Lama sat in the Arizona desert that week, exploring human nature and examining the human mind with the scrutiny of a scientist, one simple truth seemed to shine through and illuminate every discussion: the purpose of our life is happiness."}, {"text": " That simple statement can be used as a powerful tool in helping us navigate through life\u2019s daily problems. From that perspective, our task becomes one of discarding the things that lead to suffering and accumulating the things that lead to happiness. The method, the daily practice, involves gradually increasing our  \fawareness and understanding of what truly leads to happiness and what doesn\u2019t."}, {"text": " When life becomes too complicated and we feel overwhelmed, it\u2019s often useful just to stand back and remind ourselves of our overall purpose, our overall goal. When faced with a feeling of stagnation and confusion, it may be helpful to take an hour, an afternoon, or even several days to simply reflect on what it is that will truly bring us happiness, and then reset our priorities on the basis of that."}, {"text": " This can put our life back in proper context, allow a fresh perspective, and enable us to see which direction to take. From time to time we are faced with pivotal decisions that can affect the entire course of our lives. We may decide, for instance, to get married, to have children, or to embark on a  \fcourse of study to become a lawyer, an artist, or an electrician."}, {"text": " The firm resolve to become happy \u2014to learn about the factors that lead to happiness and take positive steps to build a happier life\u2014can be just such a decision. The turning-toward happiness as a valid goal and the conscious decision to seek happiness in a systematic manner can profoundly change the rest of our lives."}, {"text": " The Dalai Lama\u2019s understanding of the factors that ultimately lead to happiness is based on a lifetime of methodically observing his own mind, exploring the nature of the human condition, and investigating these things within a framework first established by The Buddha over twenty-five centuries ago."}, {"text": " And from this background, the Dalai Lama has come to some definite conclusions about which activities and thoughts  \fare most worthwhile. He summarized his beliefs in the following words that can be used as a meditation.  sometimes when I meet old friends, it reminds me how quickly time passes. And it makes me wonder if we\u2019ve utilized our time properly or not."}, {"text": " Proper utilization of time is so important. While we have this body, and especially this amazing human brain, I think every minute is something precious. Our day-to-day existence is very much alive with hope, although there is no guarantee of our future. There is no guarantee that tomorrow  \fat this time we will be here."}, {"text": " But still we are working for that purely on the basis of hope. So, we need to make the best use of our time. I believe that the proper utilization of time is this: if you can, serve other people, other sentient beings. If not, at least refrain from harming them. I think that is the whole basis of my philosophy."}, {"text": " \u201cSo, let us reflect on what is truly of value in life, what gives meaning to our lives, and set our priorities on the basis of that. The purpose of our life needs to be positive. We weren\u2019t born with the purpose of causing trouble, harming others. For our life to be of value, I think we must develop basic good human qualities\u2014warmth, kindness, compassion."}, {"text": " Then our life becomes meaningful and more peaceful\u2014happier.\u201d  \fPart II  HUMAN WARMTH AND COMPASSION  \fChapter 5  A NEW MODEL FOR INTIMACY  \fLONELINESS AND CONNECTION  Ientered the sitting room of the Dalai Lama\u2019s hotel suite, and he motioned for me to sit down. As tea was poured, he slipped off a pair of butterscotch-colored Rockports and settled comfortably into an oversized chair."}, {"text": " \u201cSo?\u201d he asked in a casual tone but with an inflection that said he was ready for anything. He smiled, but remained silent. Waiting. Moments before, while sitting in the hotel lobby waiting for our session to begin, I had absently picked up a copy of a local alternative newspaper that had been turned to the \u201cPersonals\u201d section."}, {"text": " I had briefly scanned the densely packed ads, page after page of people  \fsearching, desperately hoping to connect with another human being. Still thinking about those ads as I sat down to begin my meeting with the Dalai Lama, I suddenly decided to set aside my list of prepared questions and asked, \u201cDo you ever get lonely?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d he said simply."}, {"text": " I was unprepared for this response. I assumed that his response would be along the lines of, \u201cOf course ... every once in a while everyone feels some loneliness....\u201d Then I was planning on asking him how he deals with loneliness. I never expected to confront anyone who never felt lonely. \u201cNo?\u201d I asked again, incredulous."}, {"text": " \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cWhat do you attribute that to?\u201d He thought for a moment. \u201cI think one factor is that I look at any human being from a more  \fpositive angle; I try to look for their positive aspects. This attitude immediately creates a feeling of affinity, a kind of connectedness. \u201cAnd it may partly be because on my part, there is less apprehension, less fear, that if I act in a certain way, maybe the person will lose respect or think that I am strange."}, {"text": " So because that kind of fear and apprehension is normally absent, there is a kind of openness. I think it\u2019s the main factor.\u201d Struggling to comprehend the scope and difficulty of adopting such an attitude, I asked, \u201cBut how would you suggest that a person achieve the ability to feel that comfortable with people, not have that fear or apprehension of being disliked or judged by other people? Are there specific methods that an average person could use to develop this attitude?\u201d  \f\u201cMy basic belief is that you first need to realize the usefulness of compassion,\u201d he said with a tone of conviction."}, {"text": " \u201cThat\u2019s the key factor. Once you accept the fact that compassion is not something childish or sentimental, once you realize that compassion is something really worthwhile, realize it\u2019s deeper value, then you immediately develop an attraction towards it, a willingness to cultivate it. \u201cAnd once you encourage the thought of compassion in your mind, once that thought becomes active, then your attitude towards others changes automatically."}, {"text": " If you approach others with the thought of compassion, that will automatically reduce fear and allow an openness with other people. It creates a positive, friendly atmosphere. With that attitude, you can approach a relationship in which you, yourself, initially  \fcreate the possibility of receiving affection or a positive response from the other person."}, {"text": " And with that attitude, even if the other person is unfriendly or doesn\u2019t respond to you in a positive way, then at least you\u2019ve approached the person with a feeling of openness that gives you a certain flexibility and the freedom to change your approach as needed. That kind of openness at least allows the possibility of having a meaningful conversation with them."}, {"text": " But without the attitude of compassion, if you are feeling closed, irritated, or indifferent, then you can even be approached by your best friend and you just feel uncomfortable. \u201cI think that in many cases people tend to expect the other person to respond to them in a positive way first, rather than taking the initiative themselves to create that possibility."}, {"text": " I feel that\u2019s  \fwrong; it leads to problems and can act as a barrier that just serves to promote a feeling of isolation from others. So, if you wish to overcome that feeling of isolation and loneliness, I think that your underlying attitude makes a tremendous difference. And approaching others with the thought of compassion in your mind is the best way to do this."}, {"text": "\u201d  My surprise about the Dalai Lama\u2019s claim that he was never lonely was in direct proportion to my belief in the pervasiveness of loneliness in our society. This belief wasn\u2019t born merely from an impressionistic sense of my own loneliness or the  \fthread of loneliness that seemed to run as an underlying theme throughout the fabric of my psychiatric practice."}, {"text": " In the past twenty years, psychologists have begun to study loneliness in a scientific manner, conducting a fair number of surveys and studies on the subject. One of the most striking findings of these studies is that virtually all people report that they do experience loneliness, either currently or in the past."}, {"text": " In one large survey, one-fourth of U.S. adults reported that they had felt extremely lonely at least once within the previous two weeks. Although we often think of chronic loneliness as an affliction particularly widespread among the elderly, isolated in empty apartments or in the back wards of nursing homes, research suggests that teenagers and young adults are just as likely to report they are lonely as the elderly."}, {"text": "  \fBecause of the widespread occurrence of loneliness, investigators have begun to examine the complex variables that may contribute to loneliness. For instance, they have found that lonely individuals often have problems with selfdisclosure, have difficulty communicating with others, are poor listeners, and lack certain social skills such as picking up conversational cues (knowing when to nod, to respond appropriately, or to remain silent)."}, {"text": " This research suggests that one strategy for overcoming loneliness would be to work on improving these social skills. The Dalai Lama\u2019s strategy, bowever, seemed to bypass working on social skills or external behaviors, in favor of an approach that cut directly to the heart\u2014realizing the value of compassion and then cultivating it."}, {"text": " Despite my initial surprise, as I listened to him  \fspeak with such conviction, I came to firmly believe that he was never lonely. And there was evidence to support his claim. Often enough, I had witnessed his first interaction with a stranger, which was invariably positive. It started to become clear that these positive interactions weren\u2019t accidental or simply the result of a naturally friendly personality."}, {"text": " I sensed that he had spent a great deal of time thinking about the importance of compassion, carefully cultivating it, and using it to enrich and soften the ground of his everyday experience, making that soil fertile and receptive to positive interactions with others\u2014a method that can, in fact, be used by anyone who suffers from loneliness."}, {"text": "  \fDEPENDENCE ON OTHERS VERSUS SELF-RELIANCE  \u201cWithin all beings there is the seed of perfection. However, compassion is required in order to activate that seed which is inherent in our hearts and minds....\u201d With this, the Dalai Lama introduced the topic of compassion to a hushed assembly. Addressing an audience of fifteen hundred people, counting among them a fair proportion of dedicated students of Buddhism, he then began to discuss the Buddhist doctrine of the Field of Merit."}, {"text": " In the Buddhist sense, Merit is described as positive imprints on one\u2019s mind, or \u201cmental  \fcontinuum,\u201d that occur as a result of positive actions. The Dalai Lama explained that a Field of Merit is a source or foundation from which a person can accumulate Merit. According to Buddhist theory, it is a person\u2019s stores of Merit that determine favorable conditions for one\u2019s future rebirths."}, {"text": " He explained that Buddhist doctrine specifies two Fields of Merit: the field of the Buddhas and the field of other sentient beings. One method of accumulating Merit involves generating respect, faith, and confidence in the Buddhas, the Enlightened beings. The other method involves practicing actions like kindness, generosity, tolerance, and so on and conscious restraint from negative actions like killing, stealing, and lying."}, {"text": " That second method of acquiring Merit requires interaction with other people, rather than interaction with the Buddhas.  \fOn that basis, the Dalai Lama pointed out, other people can be of great help to us in accumulating Merit. The Dalai Lama\u2019s description of other people as a Field of Merit had a beautiful, lyrical quality to it that seemed to lend itself to a richness of imagery."}, {"text": " His lucid reasoning and the conviction behind his words combined to give special power and impact to his talk that afternoon. As I looked around the room, I could see that many members of the audience were visibly moved. I, myself, was less enthralled. As a result of our earlier conversations, I was in the rudimentary stages of appreciating the profound importance of compassion, yet I was still heavily influenced by years of rational, scientific conditioning that made me regard any talk of kindness and compassion as being a bit too sentimental for my taste."}, {"text": " As he  \fspoke, my mind began to wander. I started furtively looking around the room, searching for famous, interesting, or familiar faces. Having eaten a big meal just before the talk, I started to get sleepy. I drifted in and out. At one point in the talk, my mind tuned in to hear him say \u201c... the other day I spoke about the factors necessary to enjoy a happy and joyful life."}, {"text": " Factors such as good health, material goods, friends, and so on. If you closely investigate, you\u2019ll find that all of these depend on other people. To maintain good health, you rely on medicines made by others and health care provided by others. If you examine all of the material facilities that you use for the enjoyment of life, you\u2019ll find that there are hardly any of these material objects that have had no connection with other people."}, {"text": " If you think carefully, you\u2019ll see that all of these goods come  \finto being as a result of the efforts of many people, either directly or indirectly. Many people are involved in making those things possible. Needless to say, when we\u2019re talking about good friends and companions as being another necessary factor for a happy life, we are talking about interaction with other sentient beings, other human beings."}, {"text": " \u201cSo you can see that all of these factors are inextricably linked with other people\u2019s efforts and cooperation. Others are indispensable. So, despite the fact that the process of relating to others might involve hardships, quarrels, and cursing, we have to try to maintain an attitude of friendship and warmth in order to lead a way of life in which there is enough interaction with other people to enjoy a happy life."}, {"text": "\u201d As he spoke, I felt an instinctive resistance.  \fAlthough I\u2019ve always valued and enjoyed my friends and family, I\u2019ve considered myself to be an independent person. Self-reliant. Prided myself on this quality in fact. Secretly, I\u2019ve tended to regard overly dependent people with a kind of contempt\u2014a sign of weakness."}, {"text": " Yet that afternoon, as I listened to the Dalai Lama, something happened. As \u201cOur Dependence on Others\u201d was not my favorite topic, my mind started to wander again, and I found myself absently removing a loose thread from my shirt sleeve. Tuning in for a moment, I listened as he mentioned the many people who are involved in making all our material possessions."}, {"text": " As he said this, I began to think about how many people were involved in making my shirt. I started by imagining the farmer who grew the cotton. Next, the salesperson who sold  \fthe farmer the tractor to plow the field. Then, for that matter, the hundreds or even thousands of people involved in manufacturing that tractor, including the people who mined the ore to make the metal for each part of the tractor."}, {"text": " And all the designers of the tractor. Then, of course, the people who processed the cotton, the people who wove the cloth, and the people who cut, dyed, and sewed that cloth. The cargo workers and truck drivers who delivered the shirt to the store and the salesperson who sold the shirt to me. It occurred to me that virtually every aspect of my life came about as the results of others\u2019 efforts."}, {"text": " My precious self-reliance was a complete illusion, a fantasy. As this realization dawned on me, I was overcome with a profound sense of the interconnectedness and interdependence of all beings. I felt a softening. Something. I don\u2019t  \fknow. It made me want to cry.  \fINTIMACY  Our need for other people is paradoxical."}, {"text": " At the same time that our culture is caught up in the celebration of fierce independence, we also yearn for intimacy and connection with a special loved one. We focus all our energy on finding the one person who we hope will heal our loneliness yet prop up our illusion that we are still independent."}, {"text": " Though this connection is difficult to achieve with even one person, I would find out that the Dalai Lama is capable of and recommends maintaining closeness with as many people as possible. In fact, his aim is to connect with everyone. Meeting with him in his hotel suite in Arizona late one afternoon, I began, \u201cIn your public talk  \fyesterday afternoon you spoke of the importance of others, describing them as a Field of Merit."}, {"text": " But in examining our relationship with others, there are really so many different ways in which we can relate to one another, different kinds of relationships ...\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s very true,\u201d said the Dalai Lama. \u201cFor instance, there\u2019s a certain type of relationship that\u2019s highly valued in the West,\u201d I observed."}, {"text": " \u201cThat is a relationship that\u2019s characterized by a deep level of intimacy between two people, having one special person with whom you can share your deepest feelings, fears, and so on. People feel that unless they have a relationship of this kind that there is something missing in their lives .."}, {"text": ". In fact, Western psychotherapy often seeks to help people learn how to develop that type of intimate  \frelationship ...\u201d \u201cYes, I believe that kind of intimacy can be seen as something positive,\u201d the Dalai Lama agreed. \u201cI think if someone is deprived of that kind of intimacy then it can lead to problems ."}, {"text": "..\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just wondering then ...,\u201d I continued, \u201cwhen you were growing up in Tibet, you were not only considered to be like a king but you were also considered to be a deity. I assume that people were in awe of you, perhaps even a bit nervous or frightened to be in your presence. Didn\u2019t that create a certain emotional distance from others, a feeling of isolation? Also, being separated from your family, being raised as a monk from an early age, and as a monk never marrying and so on\u2014didn\u2019t all these things contribute to a feeling of separation from others? Do you ever feel that you missed out on  \fdeveloping a deeper level of personal intimacy with others or with one special person, such as a spouse?\u201d Without hesitation, he replied, \u201cNo."}, {"text": " I never felt a lack of intimacy. Of course my father passed away many years ago, but I felt quite close to my mother, my teachers, my tutors, and others. And with many of these people I could share my deepest feelings, fears, and concerns. When I was in Tibet, on state occasions and at public events there was a certain formality, a certain protocol was observed, but that wasn\u2019t always the case."}, {"text": " At other times, for example, I used to spend time in the kitchen and I became quite close with some of the kitchen staff and we could joke or gossip or share things and it would be quite relaxed, without that sense of formality or distance.  \f\u201cSo, when I was in Tibet or since I\u2019ve become a refugee, I\u2019ve never felt a lack of people with whom I can share things."}, {"text": " I think a lot of this has to do with my nature. It\u2019s easy for me to share things with others; I\u2019m just not good at keeping secrets!\u201d He laughed. \u201cOf course sometimes this can be a negative trait. For example, there may be some discussion in the Kashag3 about confidential things, and then I\u2019ll immediately discuss these things with others."}, {"text": " But on a personal level, being open and sharing things can be very useful. Because of this nature I can make friends more easily, and it\u2019s not just a matter of knowing people and having a superficial exchange but of really sharing my deepest problems and suffering. And it\u2019s the same thing when I hear good news; I immediately share it  \fwith others."}, {"text": " So, I feel a sense of intimacy and connection with my friends. Of course it\u2019s sometimes easier for me to establish a connection with others because they\u2019re often very happy to share their suffering or joy with the \u2018Dalai Lama,\u2019 \u2018His Holiness the Dalai Lama.\u2019\u201d He laughed again, making light of his title."}, {"text": " \u201cAnyway, I feel this sense of connection, of sharing, with many people. For instance, in the past, if I felt disappointed or unhappy with Tibetan government policy or I was concerned with other problems, even the threat of Chinese invasion, then I would return to my rooms and share this with the person who sweeps the floor."}, {"text": " From one point of view it may seem quite silly to some that the Dalai Lama, the head of the Tibetan government, facing some international or national problems, would share them with a sweeper.\u201c He  \flaughed once again. \u201dBut personally I feel it is very helpful, because then the other person participates and we can face the problem or suffering together."}, {"text": "\u201c  \fEXPANDING OUR DEFINITION OF INTIMACY  Virtually all researchers in the field of human relationships agree that intimacy is central to our existence. The influential British psychoanalyst John Bowlby wrote that \u201cintimate attachments to other human beings are the hub around which a person\u2019s life revolves ."}, {"text": ".. From these intimate attachments a person draws his strength and enjoyment of life and, through what he contributes, he gives strength and enjoyment to others. These are matters about which current science and traditional wisdom are at one.\u201d It is clear that intimacy promotes both  \fphysical and psychological well-being."}, {"text": " In looking at the health benefits of intimate relationships, medical researchers have found that people who have close friendships, people whom they can turn to for affirmation, empathy, and affection, are more likely to survive health challenges such as heart attacks and major surgery and are less likely to develop diseases such as cancer and respiratory infections."}, {"text": " For example, one study of over a thousand heart patients at Duke University Medical Center found that those who lacked a spouse or close confidant were three times more likely to die within five years of the diagnosis of heart disease as those who were married or had a close friend. Another study of thousands of residents in Alameda County, California, over a nine-year period showed that those with more social support and intimate relationships had  \flower death rates overall and lower rates of cancer."}, {"text": " And a study at the University of Nebraska School of Medicine of several hundred elderly people found that those with an intimate relationship had better immune function and lower cholesterol levels. Over the course of the past several years there have been at least a halfdozen massive investigations conducted by a number of different researchers looking at the relationship between intimacy and health."}, {"text": " After interviewing thousands of people, the various investigators all seem to have reached the same conclusion: close relationships do, in fact, promote health. Intimacy is equally as important in maintaining good emotional health. The psychoanalyst and social philosopher Erich Fromm claimed that humankind\u2019s most basic fear is the threat of being  \fseparated from other humans."}, {"text": " He believed that the experience of separateness, first encountered in infancy, is the source of all anxiety in human life. John Bowlby agreed, citing a good deal of experimental evidence and research to support the idea that separation from one\u2019s caregivers\u2014 usually the mother or father\u2014during the latter part of the first year of life, inevitably creates fear and sadness in babies."}, {"text": " He felt that separation and interpersonal loss are at the very roots of the human experiences of fear, sadness, and sorrow. So, given the vital importance of intimacy, how do we set about achieving intimacy in our daily lives? Following the Dalai Lama\u2019s approach outlined in the last section, it would seem reasonable to begin with learning\u2014with understanding what intimacy is, seeking a workable definition and model of intimacy."}, {"text": " In  \flooking to science for the answer, however, it seems that despite the universal agreement among researchers about the importance of intimacy, that seems to be where the agreement ends. Perhaps the most striking feature of even a cursory review of the various studies on intimacy is the wide diversity of definitions and theories about exactly what intimacy is."}, {"text": " At the most concrete end of the spectrum is the author Desmond Morris, who writes about intimacy from the perspective of a zoologist trained in ethology. In his book, Intimate Behavior, Morris defines intimacy: \u201cTo be intimate means to be close ... In my terms, the act of intimacy occurs whenever two individuals come into bodily contact."}, {"text": "\u201d After defining intimacy in terms of purely physical contact, he then goes on to explore the countless ways in which  \fhumans come into physical contact with one another, from a simple pat on the back to the most erotic sexual embrace. He sees touch as the vehicle through which we comfort one another and are comforted, via hugs or clasps of the hand and, when those avenues are not available to us, more indirect means of physical contact such as a manicure."}, {"text": " He even theorizes that the physical contacts we have with objects in our environment, from cigarettes to jewelry to waterbeds, act as substitutes for intimacy. Most investigators are not so concrete in their definitions of intimacy, agreeing that intimacy is more than just physical closeness. Looking at the root of the word intimacy, from the Latin intima meaning \u201cinner\u201d or \u201cinnermost,\u201d they most often subscribe to a broader definition, such as the one offered by Dr."}, {"text": " Dan McAdams, author of several  \fbooks on the subject of intimacy: \u201cThe desire for intimacy is the desire to share one\u2019s innermost self with another.\u201d But definitions of intimacy don\u2019t stop there. On the opposite end of the spectrum from Desmond Morris stand experts such as the father/son psychiatrist team, Drs."}, {"text": " Thomas Patrick Malone and Patrick Thomas Malone. In their book, The Art of Intimacy, they define intimacy as \u201cthe experience of connectivity.\u201d Their understanding of intimacy begins with a thorough examination of our \u201cconnectivity\u201d with other people, but they do not, however, limit their concept of intimacy to human relationships."}, {"text": " Their definition is so broad, in fact, that it includes our relationship with inanimate objects\u2014trees, stars, and even space. Concepts of the most ideal form of intimacy  \falso vary throughout the world and history. The romantic notion of that \u201cOne Special Person\u201d with whom we have a passionate intimate relationship is a product of our time and culture."}, {"text": " But this model of intimacy is not universally accepted among all cultures. For instance, the Japanese seem to rely more on friendships to gain intimacy, whereas Americans seek it more in romantic relationships with a boyfriend, girlfriend, or spouse. In noting this, some researchers have suggested that Asians who tend to be less focused on personal feelings such as passion and are more concerned with the practical aspects of social attachments appear less vulnerable to the kind of disillusionment that leads to the crumbling of relationships."}, {"text": " In addition to variations among cultures, concepts of intimacy have also dramatically  \fchanged over time. In colonial America, the level of physical intimacy and proximity was generally greater than it is today, as family and even strangers shared close spaces and slept together in one room and used a common room for bathing, eating, and sleeping."}, {"text": " Yet the customary level of communication among spouses was quite formal by today\u2019s standards\u2014not much different from the way acquaintances or neighbors spoke to one another. Only a century later, love and marriage became highly romanticized and intimate self-disclosure was expected to be an ingredient in any loving partnership."}, {"text": " Ideas of what is considered to be private and intimate behavior have also changed over time. In sixteenth-century Germany, for instance, a new husband and wife were expected to consummate their marriage on a bed carried by witnesses who  \fwould validate the marriage. How people express their emotions has also changed."}, {"text": " In the Middle Ages it was considered normal to publicly express a wide range of feelings with great intensity and directness\u2014joy, rage, fear, piety, and even pleasure at torturing and killing enemies. Extremes of hysterical laughter, passionate weeping, and violent rage were expressed much more than would be accepted in our society."}, {"text": " But the commonplace expression of emotions and feelings in that society ruled out the concept of emotional intimacy; if one is to display all emotions openly and indiscriminately, then there are no private feelings left to express to a special few. Clearly, the notions we take for granted about intimacy are not universal."}, {"text": " They change over time and are often shaped by economic, social, and  \fcultural conditions. And it is easy to become confused by the variety of different contemporary Western definitions of intimacy\u2014with manifestations ranging from a haircut to our relationship with Neptune\u2019s moons. So where does this leave us in our quest to understand what intimacy is? I think that the implication is clear: There is an incredible diversity among human lives, infinite variations among people with respect to how they can experience a sense of closeness."}, {"text": " This realization alone offers us a great opportunity. It means that at this very moment we have vast resources of intimacy available to us. Intimacy is all around us. Today, so many of us are oppressed by a feeling of something missing in our lives, intensely suffering from a lack of intimacy. This is  \fparticularly true when we go through the inevitable periods in our life when we\u2019re not involved in a romantic relationship or when the passion wanes from a relationship."}, {"text": " There\u2019s a widespread notion in our culture that deep intimacy is best achieved within the context of a passionate romantic relationship\u2014that Special Someone who we set apart from all others. This can be a profoundly limiting viewpoint, cutting us off from other potential sources of intimacy, and the cause of much misery and unhappiness when that Special Someone isn\u2019t there."}, {"text": " But we have within our power the means to avoid this; we need only courageously expand our concept of intimacy to include all the other forms that surround us on a daily basis. By broadening our definition of intimacy, we open ourselves to discovering many new and equally  \fsatisfying ways of connecting with others."}, {"text": " This brings us back to my initial discussion of loneliness with the Dalai Lama, a discussion triggered by a chance perusal of the \u201cPersonals\u201d section of a local newspaper. It makes me wonder. At the very moment that those people were composing their ads, struggling to find just the right words that would bring romance into their lives and end the loneliness, how many of those people were already surrounded by friends, family, or acquaintances\u2014relationships that could easily be cultivated into genuine and deeply satisfying intimate relationships? Many, I would guess."}, {"text": " If what we seek in life is happiness, and intimacy is an important ingredient of a happier life, then it clearly makes sense to conduct our lives on the basis of a model of intimacy that includes as many forms of  \fconnection with others as possible. The Dalai Lama\u2019s model of intimacy is based on a willingness to open ourselves to many others, to family, friends, and even strangers, forming genuine and deep bonds based on our common humanity."}, {"text": "  \fChapter 6  DEEPENING OUR CONNECTION TO OTHERS  One afternoon following his public lecture, I arrived at the Dalai Lama\u2019s hotel suite for my daily appointment. I was a few minutes early. An  \fattendant discreetly glided into the hallway to relate that His Holiness was occupied in a private audience and would be several more minutes."}, {"text": " I assumed my familiar post outside his hotel suite door and used the time to review my notes in preparation for our session, trying at the same time to avoid the suspicious gaze of a security guard\u2014the same look perfected by convenience store clerks for use on junior high school students loitering around the magazine racks."}, {"text": " Within a few moments, the door opened and a well-dressed middle-aged couple were shown out. They looked familiar. I remembered that I had been briefly introduced to them several days earlier. I had been told that the wife was a wellknown heiress and the husband an extremely wealthy, high-powered Manhattan attorney."}, {"text": " At the time of introduction we had only exchanged a  \ffew words, but they had both struck me as unbelievably haughty. As they emerged from the Dalai Lama\u2019s hotel suite, I noted a startling change. Gone was the arrogant manner and smug expressions, and in their place were two faces suffused with tenderness and emotion."}, {"text": " They were like two children. Streams of tears ran down both faces. Although the Dalai Lama\u2019s effect on others was not always so dramatic, I noticed that invariably others responded to him with some shift of emotion. I had long marveled at his ability to bond with others, whatever their walk of life, and establish a deep and meaningful emotional exchange."}, {"text": "  \fESTABLISHING EMPATHY  While we had spoken of the importance of human warmth and compassion during our conversations in Arizona, it wasn\u2019t until some months later at his home in Dharamsala that I had an opportunity to explore human relationships with him in greater detail. By that time I was very eager to see if we could discover an underlying set of principles that he uses in his interactions with others\u2014principles that might be applied to improve any relationship, whether it be with strangers, family, friends, or lovers."}, {"text": " Anxious to begin, I jumped right in: \u201cNow, on the topic of human relationships ... what would you say is the most effective method  \for technique of connecting with others in a meaningful way and of reducing conflicts with others?\u201d He glared at me for a moment. It wasn\u2019t an unkindly glare, but it made me feel as if I had just asked him to give me the precise chemical composition of moon dust."}, {"text": " After a brief pause, he responded, \u201cWell, dealing with others is a very complex issue. There is no way that you can come up with one formula that could solve all problems. It\u2019s a bit like cooking. If you are cooking a very delicious meal, a special meal, then there are various stages in the cooking."}, {"text": " You may have to first boil the vegetables separately and then you have to fry them and then you combine them in a special way, mixing in spices and so on. And finally, the end result would be this delicious product.  \fSimilarly here, in order to be skillful in dealing with others, you need many factors."}, {"text": " You can\u2019t just say, \u2018This is the method\u2019 or \u2019This is the technique.\u2018\u201d It wasn\u2019t exactly the answer I was looking for. I thought he was being evasive and felt that surely he must have something more concrete to offer. I pressed on: \u201cWell, given that there is no single solution to improving our relationships, are there perhaps some more general guidelines that might be useful?\u201d The Dalai Lama thought for a moment before replying, \u201cYes."}, {"text": " Earlier we spoke of the importance of approaching others with the thought of compassion in one\u2019s mind. That is crucial. Of course, just telling someone, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s very important to be compassionate; you must have more love\u2019 isn\u2019t enough. A simple  \fprescription like that alone isn\u2019t going to work."}, {"text": " But one effective means of teaching someone how to be more warm and compassionate is to begin by using reasoning to educate the individual about the value and practical benefits of compassion, and also having them reflect on how they feel when someone is kind to them and so on. In a sense this primes them, so there will be more of an effect as they proceed in their efforts to be more compassionate."}, {"text": " \u201cNow in looking at the various means of developing compassion, I think that empathy is an important factor. The ability to appreciate another\u2019s suffering. In fact, traditionally, one of the Buddhist techniques for enhancing compassion involves imagining a situation where there is a sentient being suffering\u2014for instance, like a sheep about to be slaughtered by the  \fbutcher."}, {"text": " And then try to imagine the suffering that the sheep may be going through and so on ...\u201d The Dalai Lama stopped for a moment to reflect, absently running a string of prayer beads through his fingers. He commented, \u201cIt occurs to me that if we were dealingwith someone who was very cold and indifferent, then this kind of technique may not be very effective."}, {"text": " It would be as if you were to ask the butcher to do this visualization: the butcher is so hardened, so used to the whole thing, that itwouldn\u2019t have any impact. So, for example, it would be very difficult to explain and utilize that technique for some Westerners who are accustomed to hunting and fishing for fun, as a form of recreation ."}, {"text": "..\u201d \u201cIn that case,\u201d I suggested, \u201cit might not be an effective technique to ask a hunter to imagine the suffering of his prey, but you might be able to  \fawaken feelings of compassion by beginning with having him visualize his favorite hunting dog caught in a trap and squealing with pain ..."}, {"text": "\u201d \u201cYes, exactly ...\u201d agreed the Dalai Lama. \u201cI think depending on the circumstances one might modify that technique. For instance, the person may not have a strong feeling of empathy towards animals but at least may have some empathy towards a close family member or friend. In that case the person could visualize a situation where the beloved person is suffering or going through a tragic situation and then imagine how he or she would respond to that, react to that."}, {"text": " So one can attempt to increase compassion by trying to empathize with another\u2019s feeling or experience. \u201cI think that empathy is important not only as a means of enhancing compassion, but I think  \fthat generally speaking, when dealing with others on any level, if you\u2019re having some difficulties, it\u2019s extremely helpful to be able to try to put yourself in the other person\u2019s place and see how you would react to the situation."}, {"text": " Even if you have no common experience with the other person or have a very different lifestyle, you can try to do this through imagination. You may need to be slightly creative. This technique involves the capacity to temporarily suspend insisting on your own viewpoint but rather to look from the other person\u2019s perspective, to imagine what would be the situation if you were in his shoes, how you would deal with this."}, {"text": " This helps you develop an awareness and respect for another\u2019s feelings, which is an important factor in reducing conflicts and problems with other people.\u201d  \fOur interview that afternoon was brief. I had been fitted into the Dalai Lama\u2019s busy schedule at the last minute, and like several of our conversations, it occurred late in the day."}, {"text": " Outside, the sun was beginning to set, filling the room with a bittersweet dusky light, turning the pale yellow walls a deep amber, and illuminating the Buddhist icons in the room with rich golden hues. The Dalai Lama\u2019s attendant silently entered the room, signaling the end of our session. Wrapping up the discussion, I asked, \u201cI know that we have to close, but do you have any other words of advice or methods that you use to help establish empathy with others?\u201d Echoing the words he had spoken in Arizona many months before, with a gentle simplicity he  \fanswered, \u201cWhenever I meet people I always approach them from the standpoint of the most basic things we have in common."}, {"text": " We each have a physical structure, a mind, emotions. We are all born in the same way, and we all die. All of us want happiness and do notwant to suffer. Looking at others from this standpoint rather than emphasizing secondary differences such as the fact that I am Tibetan, or a different color, religion, or cultural background, allows me to have a feeling that I\u2019m meeting someone just the same as me."}, {"text": " I find that relating to others on that level makes it much easier to exchange and communicate with one another.\u201d With that, he rose, smiled, clasped my hand briefly, and retired for the evening.  \fThe following morning, we continued our discussion at the Dalai Lama\u2019s home. \u201cIn Arizona we spoke a great deal about the importance of compassion in human relationships, and yesterday we discussed the role of empathy in improving our ability to relate to one another ."}, {"text": "..\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d the Dalai Lama nodded. \u201cBesides that, can you suggest any additional specific methods or techniques to help one deal more effectively with other people?\u201d \u201cWell, as I mentioned yesterday, there is no way that you can come up with one or two simple techniques that can solve all problems."}, {"text": " Having said that, however, I think there are some other factors that can help one deal with others more skillfully. First, it is helpful to understand and appreciate the background of the people you  \fare dealing with. Also, being more open-minded and honest are useful qualities when it comes to dealing with others."}, {"text": "\u201d I waited, but he didn\u2019t say anything more. \u201cCan you suggest any other methods of improving our relationships?\u201d The Dalai Lama thought for a moment. \u201cNo,\u201d he laughed. I felt that these particular bits of advice were too simplistic, commonplace really. Still, as that seemed to be all he had to say on the subject for the moment, we turned to other topics."}, {"text": "  That evening, I was invited to dinner at the home of some Tibetan friends in Dharamsala. My  \ffriends arranged an evening that proved to be quite lively. The meal was excellent, featuring a dazzling array of special dishes and starring Tibetan Mo Mos, a tasty meat dumpling. As dinner wore on, the conversation became more animated."}, {"text": " Soon, the guests were swapping offcolor stories about the most embarrassing thing they ever did while drunk. Several guests had been invited to the gathering, including a wellknown couple from Germany, the wife an architect and the husband a writer, author of a dozen books. Having an interest in books, I approached the author and began a conversation."}, {"text": " I asked about his writing. His replies were short and perfunctory, his manner blunt and standoffish. Thinking him rather unfriendly, even snobbish, I took an immediate dislike to him. Well, at least I  \fmade an attempt to connect with him, I consoled myself, and, satisfied that he was simply a disagreeable person, I turned to conversation with some of the more amiable guests."}, {"text": " The following day, I ran into a friend at a cafe in the village and over tea I recounted the events of the evening before. \u201c... I really enjoyed everyone, except for Rolf, that writer ... He seemed so arrogant or something ... so unfriendly.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve known him for several years,\u201d my friend said, \u201c."}, {"text": ".. I know that he comes across that way, but it\u2019s just that he\u2019s a bit shy, a bit reserved at first. He really is a wonderful person if you get to know him ...\u201d I wasn\u2019t convinced. My friend continued, explaining, \u201c... even though he is a successful writer, he has had more than his share of difficulties in his life."}, {"text": " Rolf has really suffered a  \flot. His family suffered tremendously at the hand of the Nazis during World War II. And he\u2019s had two children, whom he has been very devoted to, born with some rare genetic disorder that left them extremely physically and mentally handicapped. And instead of becoming bitter or spending his life playing the martyr, he dealt with his problems by reaching out to others and spent many years devoting himself to working with the handicapped as a volunteer."}, {"text": " He really is quite special if you get to know him.\u201d As it turned out, I met Rolf and his wife once again at the end of that week, at a small strip field serving as the local airport. We were scheduled on the same flight to Delhi, which turned out to be canceled. The next flight to Delhi wasn\u2019t for several days, so we decided to share a car to Delhi, a grueling ten-hour ride."}, {"text": " The few bits of  \fbackground information that my friend had shared with me had changed my feeling toward Rolf, and on the long ride down to Delhi I felt more open toward him. As a result, I made an effort to sustain a conversation with him. Initially, his manner remained the same. But with just that little bit of openness and persistence, I soon discovered that, as my friend had said, his standoffishness was more likely due to shyness than snobbery."}, {"text": " As we rattled through the sweltering, dusty northern Indian coun tryside, moving ever deeper into conversation, he proved to be a warm, genuine human being and a stalwart traveling companion. By the time we reached Delhi, I realized that the Dalai Lama\u2019s advice to \u201cunderstand the background of people\u201d was not as elementary and superficial as it first appeared."}, {"text": " Yes, it was  \fsimple perhaps, but not simplistic. Sometimes it is the most basic and straightforward of advice, the kind that we tend to dismiss as naive, that can be the most effective means of enhancing communication.  Several days later I was still in Delhi on a twoday stopover before returning home."}, {"text": " The change from the tranquillity of Dharamsala was jarring, and I was in a foul mood. Besides bat tling the stifling heat, the pollution, and the crowds, the side-walks swarmed with a common species of  \furban predator dedicated to the Street Swindle. Walking the scorching Delhi streets, a Westerner, a Foreigner, a Target, approached by a halfdozen hustlers per block, it felt as if I had \u201cCHUMP\u201d tattooed on my forehead."}, {"text": " It was demoralizing. That morning, I fell for a common two-man street scam. One partner splattered a splotch of red paint on my shoes while I wasn\u2019t looking. Down the block, his confederate, an innocent looking shoeshine boy, brought the paint to my attention and offered to shine my shoes at the usual going rate."}, {"text": " He deftly shined the shoes within minutes. When finished, he calmly demanded a huge sum\u2014two months wages for many in Delhi. When I balked, he claimed that that was the price he had quoted me. I objected again, and the boy began to bellow, drawing a crowd,  \fcrying that I was refusing to pay him for services already rendered."}, {"text": " Later that day I learned that this was a common scam played on unsuspecting tourists; after demanding a huge sum, the shoeshine boy deliberately raises a fuss, drawing a crowd, with the intention of extorting the money from the tourist by embarrassment and the desire to avoid a scene. That afternoon I lunched with a colleague at my hotel."}, {"text": " The events of the morning were quickly forgotten as she inquired about my recent series of interviews with the Dalai Lama. We became engrossed in a discussion about the Dalai Lama\u2019s ideas regarding empathy and the importance of taking the other person\u2019s perspective. After lunch we jumped into a cab and set off to visit some mutual friends."}, {"text": " As the cab pulled away, my thoughts returned to the shoeshine scam that  \fmorning, and as dark images rustled in my mind, I happened to glance at the meter. \u201cStop the taxi!\u201d I yelled. My friend jumped at the sudden outburst. The taxi driver scowled at me in the rearview mirror but kept driving."}, {"text": " \u201cPull over!\u201d I demanded, my voice now quivering with a trace of hysteria. My friend appeared shocked. The taxi stopped. I pointed at the meter, furiously stabbing at the air. \u201cYou didn\u2019t reset the meter! There was over twenty rupees on the meter when we started!\u201d \u201cSo sorry, sir,\u201d he said with a dull indifference that further infuriated me, \u201cI forgot to reset."}, {"text": "... I will restart ...\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not restarting anything!\u201d I exploded. \u201cI\u2019m fed up with you people trying to pad fares, drive around in circles, or do whatever you can to rip people off ... I\u2019m just ... just ... fed up!\u201d I  \fsputtered and fumed with a sanctimonious intensity. My friend looked embarrassed."}, {"text": " The taxi driver merely stared at me with the same defiant expression found most often among the sacred cows that strolled out into the middle of a busy Delhi street and stopped, with the seditious intent to hold up traffic. He looked at me as if my outburst was merely tiresome and boring. I threw a few rupees into the front seat, and without further comment opened the car door for my friend and followed her out."}, {"text": " Within a few minutes we hailed another taxi and were on our way again. But I couldn\u2019t let it drop. As we drove through the streets of Delhi, I continued to complain about how \u201ceveryone\u201d in Delhi was out to cheat tourists and that we were nothing but quarry. My colleague listened silently as I ranted and raved."}, {"text": " Finally she said, \u201cWell,  \ftwenty rupees is only around a quarter. Why get so worked up?\u201d I seethed with pious indignation. \u201cBut it\u2019s the principle that counts!\u201d I proclaimed. \u201cI can\u2019t see how you can be so calm about this whole thing anyway when it happens all the time. Doesn\u2019t it bother you?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d she said slowly, \u201cit did for a minute, but I started thinking about what we were talking about at lunch, about the Dalai Lama saying how important it is to see things from another\u2019s perspective."}, {"text": " While youwere getting worked up, I tried to think about what I might have in common with the cabdriver. We both want good food to eat, to sleep well, to feel good, to be loved, and so on. Then, I tried to imagine myself as the cabdriver. I sit in a stifling cab all day without air conditioning, maybe I\u2019m angry and jealous of rich  \fforeigners."}, {"text": "... and the best way I can come up with to try to make things \u2018fair,\u2019 to be happy, is to derive ways to cheat people out of their money. But the thing is, even when it works and I squeeze a few extra rupees out of an unsuspecting tourist, I can\u2019t imagine that it\u2019s a very satisfying way to be happier or a very satisfying life."}, {"text": "... Anyway, the more I imagined myself as the cabdriver, somehow the less angry I was at him. His life just seemed sad.... I mean, I still don\u2019t agree with what he did and we were right to get out of the cab, but I just couldn\u2019t get worked up enough to hate him for it....\u201d I was silent. Startled, in fact, at how little I had actually absorbed from the Dalai Lama."}, {"text": " By that time I was beginning to develop an appreciation of the practical value of his advice, such as \u201cunderstanding another\u2019s background,\u201d  \fand of course I found his examples of how he implemented these principles in his own life to be inspiring. But as I thought back over our series of discussions, beginning in Arizona and now continuing in India, I realized that right from the beginning our interviews had taken on a clinical tone, as if I were asking him about human anatomy, only in this case, it was the anatomy of the human mind and spirit."}, {"text": " Until that moment, however, somehow it hadn\u2019t occurred to me to apply his ideas fully to my own life, at least not right now\u2014I always had a vague intention of trying to implement his ideas in my life at some point in the future, perhaps when I had more time.  \fEXAMINING THE UNDERLYING BASIS OF A RELATIONSHIP  My conversations with the Dalai Lama in Arizona had begun with a discussion about the sources of happiness."}, {"text": " And despite the fact that he has chosen to live his life as a monk, studies have shown that marriage is a factor that can, in fact, bring happiness\u2014providing the intimacy and close bonds that enhance health and overall life satisfaction. There have been many thousands of surveys of Americans and Europeans that show that generally, married people are happier and more satisfied with life than single or widowed people\u2014or especially compared to divorced or  \fseparated people."}, {"text": " One survey found that six in ten Americans who rate their marriage as \u201cvery happy\u201d also rate their life as a whole as \u201cvery happy.\u201d In discussing the topic of human relationships, I thought it important to bring up the subject of that common source of happiness. Minutes before one scheduled interview with the Dalai Lama, I sat with a friend on an outdoor patio at the hotel in Tucson enjoying a cool drink."}, {"text": " Mentioning the topics of romance and marriage which I was intending to bring up in my interview, my friend and I soon began commiserating about being single. As we talked, a healthy-looking young couple, golfers maybe, happily vacationing on the cusp of the tourist season, sat down at a table near us."}, {"text": " They had the look of a midrange marriage\u2014no longer honeymooners perhaps, but still young and no doubt in love. It must be nice, I  \fthought. No sooner had they sat down, than they began to bicker. \u201c... I told you we\u2019d be late!\u201d the woman accused acidly, her voice surprisingly husky, the rasp of vocal cords pickled by years of cigarette smoke and alcohol."}, {"text": " \u201cNow we barely have enough time to eat. I can\u2019t even enjoy my food!\u201d \u201c... if you didn\u2019t take so long to get ready ...\u201d the man shot back automatically, in quieter tones, but every syllable laden with annoyance and hostility. Rebuttal. \u201cI was ready a half-hour ago. You\u2019re the one who had to finish reading the paper ."}, {"text": "..\u201d And on it went. It didn\u2019t stop. Like the Greek dramatist Euripides said, \u201cMarry, and it may go well. But when a marriage fails, then those who  \fmarry live at home in hell.\u201d The argument, rapidly escalating, put a quick end to our lamentations about the single life. My friend merely rolled his eyes and, quoting a line from Seinfeld, said, \u201cOh yeah! I want to get married real soon!\u201d  Only moments before, I had every intention of starting our session by soliciting the Dalai Lama\u2019s opinion about the joys and virtues of romance and marriage."}, {"text": " Instead, I entered his hotel suite and almost before sitting down, asked, \u201cWhy do you suppose that conflicts seem to arise so often in marriages?\u201d \u201cWhen dealing with conflicts, of course it can  \fbe quite complex,\u201d the Dalai Lama explained. \u201cThere can be many factors involved. So, when we are dealing with trying to understand relationship problems, the first stage in this process involves deliberately reflecting on the underlying nature and basis of that relationship."}, {"text": " \u201cSo, first of all, one has to recognize that there are different types of relationships and understand the differences between them. For example, leaving aside the issue of marriage for a moment, even within ordinary friendships we can recognize that there are different types of friendships. Some friendships are based on wealth, power, or position."}, {"text": " In these cases your friendship continues as long as your power, wealth, or position is sustained. Once these grounds are no longer there, then the friendship  \fwill also begin to disappear. On the other hand, there is another kind of friendship. Friendships that are based not on considerations of wealth, power, and position but rather on true human feeling, a feeling of closeness in which there is a sense of sharing and connectedness."}, {"text": " This type of friendship is what I would call genuine friendship because it would not be affected by the status of the individual\u2019s wealth, position, or power, whether it is increasing or whether it is declining. The factor that sustains a genuine friendship is a feeling of affection. If you lack that, then you won\u2019t be able to sustain a genuine friendship."}, {"text": " Of course, we have mentioned this before and all this is very obvious, but if you\u2019re running into relationship problems, it\u2019s often very helpful to simply stand back and reflect on the basis of that relationship.  \f\u201cIn the same way, if someone is running into problems with his or her spouse, it can be helpful to look at the underlying basis of the relationship."}, {"text": " For example, you often find relationships very much based on immediate sexual attraction. When a couple has just met, seen each other on just a few occasions, they may be madly in love and very happy,\u201d he laughed, \u201cbut any decision about marriage made at that instant would be very shaky. Just as one can become, in some sense, insane from the power of intense anger or hatred, it is also possible for an individual to become in some sense insane by the power of passion or lust."}, {"text": " And sometimes you might even find situations where an individual could feel, \u2018Oh, my boyfriend or girlfriend is not really a good person, not a kind person, but still I feel attracted to him or her.\u2019 So a relationship that is  \fbased on that initial attraction is very unreliable, very unstable, because it is very much based on temporary phenomena."}, {"text": " That feeling is very short lived, so after some time, that will go.\u201d He snapped his fingers. \u201cSo it shouldn\u2019t be much of a surprise if that kind of relationship runs into trouble, and a marriage based on that will eventually run into trouble ... But what do you think?\u201d \u201cYes, I\u2019d have to agree with you on that,\u201d I answered."}, {"text": " \u201cIt seems that in any relationship, even the most ardent ones, the initial passion eventually cools down. Some research has shown that those who regard the initial passion and romance as essential to their relationship may end up disillusioned or divorced. One social psychologist, Ellen Berscheid, at the University of Minnesota I think, looked at that issue and  \fconcluded that the failure to appreciate the limited half-life of passionate love can doom a relationship."}, {"text": " She and her colleagues felt that the increase in divorce rates over the past twenty years is partly linked to the increased importance people place on intense positive emotional experiences in their lives\u2014experiences like romantic love. But one problem is that those types of experiences may be particularly difficult to sustain over time ."}, {"text": "..\u201d \u201cThis seems very true,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, when dealing with relationship problems you can see the tremendous importance of examining and understanding the underlying nature of the relationship. \u201cNow, while some relationships are based on immediate sexual attraction, you can have other types of relationships, on the other hand, in which  \fthe person in a cool state of mind will realize that physically speaking, in terms of appearance, my boyfriend or girlfriend may not be that attractive but he or she is really a good person, a kind, gentle person."}, {"text": " A relationship that is built on that forms a kind of a bond that is more long lasting, because there is a kind of genuine communication at a very human and personal level between the two ...\u201d The Dalai Lama paused for a moment as if mulling the issue over, then added, \u201cOf course, I should make it clear that one can have a good, healthy relationship that includes sexual attraction as one component."}, {"text": " So it seems, then, that there can be two principal types of relationships based on sexual attraction. One type is based on pure sexual desire. In this case the motive or the impetus behind the bond really is just temporary  \fsatisfaction, immediate gratification. In that type of relationship, individuals are relating to each other not so much as people but rather as objects."}, {"text": " That type of relationship is not very sound. If the relationship is based only on sexual desire, without a component of mutual respect, then the relationship becomes almost like prostitution, in which neither side has respect for the other. A relationship built primarily on sexual desire is like a house built on a foundation of ice; as soon as the ice melts, the building collapses."}, {"text": " \u201cHowever, there is a second type of relationship which is also based on sexual attraction, but in which the physical attraction is not the predominant basis of the relationship. In this second type of relationship there is an underlying appreciation of the value of the other person based on your feeling that the other  \fperson is kind, nice, and gentle, and you accord respect and dignity to that other individual."}, {"text": " Any relationship that is based on that will be much more long lasting and reliable. It\u2019s more appropriate. And in order to establish that type of relationship, it is crucial to spend enough time to get to know each other in a genuine sense, to know each other\u2019s basic characteristics. \u201cTherefore, when my friends ask me about their marriage, I usually ask how long they\u2019ve known each other."}, {"text": " If they say a few months, then I usually say, \u2018Oh, this is too short.\u2019 If they say a few years, then it seems to be better. Now they not only know each other\u2019s face or appearance but, I think, the deeper nature of the other person ...\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s kind of like Mark Twain\u2019s quote that \u2018no man or woman really knows what perfect  \flove is until they have been married a quarter of a century ."}, {"text": "..\u201d The Dalai Lama nodded and continued, \u201cYes ... So, I think many problems occur simply because of insufficient time to know each other. Anyway, I think that if one is seeking to build a truly satisfying relationship, the best way of bringing this about is to get to know the deeper nature of the person and relate to her or him on that level, instead of merely on the basis of superficial characteristics ."}, {"text": " And in this type of relationship there is a role for genuine compassion. \u201cNow, I\u2019ve heard many people claim that their marriage has a deeper meaning than just a sexual relationship, that marriage involves two people trying to bond their lives together, share life\u2019s ups and downs together, share a certain  \fintimacy."}, {"text": " If that claim is honest, then I believe that\u2019s the proper basis on which a relationship should be built. A sound relationship should include a sense of responsibility and commitment towards each other. Of course, the physical contact, the appropriate or normal sexual relationship between a couple, can provide a certain satisfaction that could have a calming effect on one\u2019s mind."}, {"text": " But, after all, biologically speaking, the main purpose of a sexual relationship is reproduction. And to successfully achieve that, you need to have a sense of commitment towards the offspring, in order for them to survive and thrive. So, developing a capacity for responsibility and commitment is crucial."}, {"text": " Without that, the relationship provides only temporary satisfaction. It\u2019s just for fun.\u201d He laughed, a laugh that seemed to be infused with  \fwonder at the vast scope of human behavior.  \fRELATIONSHIPS BASED ON ROMANCE  It felt odd, speaking about sex and marriage to a man, now over sixty years old, who had been celibate all his life."}, {"text": " He didn\u2019t seem averse to talking about these issues, but there was a certain detachment to his comments. In thinking about our conversation later that evening, it occurred to me that there was still one important component of relationships that we hadn\u2019t covered, and I was curious to learn of his take on the subject."}, {"text": " I brought it up the following day. \u201cYesterday we were discussing relationships  \fand the importance of basing a close relationship or marriage on more than just sex,\u201d I began. \u201cBut, in Western culture, it is not just the physical sex act but the whole idea of romance\u2014the idea of falling in love, of being deeply in love with one\u2019s partner\u2014that is seen as a highly desirable thing."}, {"text": " In movies, literature, and popular culture there\u2019s a kind of exaltation of this kind of romantic love. What\u2019s your view of this?\u201d Without hesitation, the Dalai Lama said, \u201cI think that, leaving aside how the endless pursuit of romantic love may affect our deeper spiritual growth, even from the perspective of a conventional way of life, the idealization of this romantic love can be seen as an extreme."}, {"text": " Unlike those relationships based on caring and genuine affection, this is another matter. It cannot be seen as a positive thing,\u201d he said decisively. \u201cIt\u2019s  \fsomething that is based on fantasy, unattainable, and therefore may be a source of frustration. So, on that basis it cannot be seen as a positive thing."}, {"text": "\u201d There was a finality to the Dalai Lama\u2019s tone which conveyed that he had nothing more to say on the subject. In view of the tremendous emphasis our society places on romance, I felt that he was dismissing the lure of romantic love too lightly. Given the Dalai Lama\u2019s monastic upbringing, I supposed that he didn\u2019t fully appreciate the joys of romance, and questioning him further about issues related to romance would be as helpful as asking him to come out to the parking lot to take a look at a problem I was having with my car\u2019s transmission."}, {"text": " Mildly disappointed, I fumbled with my notes for several moments and passed on to other topics.  \fWhat is it that makes romance so appealing? In looking at this question, one finds that Eros\u2014 romantic, sexual, passionate love\u2014the ultimate ecstasy, is a potent cocktail of cultural, biological, and psychological ingredients."}, {"text": " In Western culture, the idea of romantic love has flourished over the past two hundred years under the influence of Romanticism, a movement which has done much to shape our perception of the world. Romanticism grew up as a rejection of the previous Age of Enlightenment, with its emphasis on human reason."}, {"text": " The new movement exalted intuition, emotion, feeling, and passion. It emphasized the importance of the sensory world,  \fthe subjective experience of the individual, and tended toward the world of imagination, of fantasy, the search for a world that is not\u2014an idealized past or utopian future. This idea has had profound impact not only in art and literature but also in politics and all aspects of the development of modern Western culture."}, {"text": " The most compelling element of our pursuit of romance is the feeling of falling in love. Powerful forces are at work driving us to seek this feeling, much more than simply the glorification of romantic love which we pick up from our culture. Many researchers feel that these forces are programmed into our genes from birth."}, {"text": " The feeling of falling in love, invariably mixed with a sense of sexual attraction, may be a genetically determined instinctual component of mating behavior. From an evolutionary perspective, the  \fnumber-one job of the organism is to survive, reproduce, and assure continued survival of the species."}, {"text": " It is in the best interest of the species, therefore, if we are programmed to fall in love; it certainly increases the odds that we will mate and reproduce. Thus, we have built-in mechanisms to help make that happen; in response to certain stimuli, our brains manufacture and pump out chemicals that create a euphoric feeling, the \u201chigh\u201d associated with falling in love."}, {"text": " And while our brains are marinading in those chemicals, that feeling so overwhelms us at times that everything else seems to be blocked out. The psychological forces driving us to seek the feeling of being in love are as compelling as the biological forces. In Plato\u2019s Symposium, Socrates tells the story of the myth of Aristophanes, concerning the origin of sexual  \flove."}, {"text": " According to this myth, the original inhabitants of Earth were round creatures with four hands and four feet and with their back and sides forming a circle. These self-sufficient sexless beings were very arrogant and repeatedly attacked the gods. To punish them, Zeus hurled thunderbolts at them and split them apart."}, {"text": " Each creature was now two, each half longing to merge with its other half. Eros, the drive toward passionate, romantic love, can be seen as this ancient desire for fusion with the other half. It seems to be a universal, unconscious human need. The feeling involves a sensation of merging with the other, of boundaries breaking down, of becoming one with the loved one."}, {"text": " Psychologists call this the collapse of ego boundaries. Some feel that this process is rooted in our earliest experience, an unconscious  \fattempt to re-create the experience we had as infants, a primal state in which the child is completely merged with the parent or primary caregiver. Evidence suggests that newborn infants do not distinguish between themselves and the rest of the universe."}, {"text": " They have no sense of personal identity, or at least their identity includes the mother, others, and all objects in their environment. They don\u2019t know where they end and the \u201cother\u201d begins. They lack what is known as object permanence: objects have no independent existence; if they are not interacting with an object, it doesn\u2019t exist."}, {"text": " For example, if an infant is holding a rattle, the baby recognizes the rattle as part of herself or himself, and if the rattle is taken away and hidden from view, it ceases to exist.  \fAt birth, the brain is not yet fully \u201chard wired,\u201d but as the baby grows and the brain matures, the baby\u2019s interaction with the world becomes more sophisticated and the baby gradually gains a sense of personal identity, of \u201cme\u201d as opposed to \u201cother."}, {"text": "\u201d Along with this, a sense of isolation develops, and gradually the child develops an awareness of his or her own limitations. The formation of identity, of course, continues to develop throughout childhood and adolescence as the child comes in contact with the world. People\u2019s sense of who they are comes about as the result of developing internal representations, formed in large part by reflections of their early interactions with the important people in their lives, and reflections of their role in society in general."}, {"text": " Gradually, the personal identity and intrapsychic structure become more complex.  \fBut some part of us may still seek to regress to an earlier state of existence, a state of bliss in which there is no feeling of isolation, no feeling of separation. Many contemporary psychologists feel that the early \u201coneness\u201d experience is incorporated into our subconscious mind, and as an adult it permeates our unconscious and private fantasies."}, {"text": " They believe that the merging with the loved one when one is \u201cin love\u201d echoes the experience of being merged with the mother in infancy. It re-creates that magic feeling, a feeling of omnipotence, as if all things are possible. A feeling like that is hard to beat. It is no wonder then that the pursuit of romantic love is so powerful."}, {"text": " So what\u2019s the problem, and why does the Dalai Lama so easily assert that the pursuit of romance is a negative thing?  \fI considered the problem of basing a relationship on romantic love, of taking refuge in romance as a source of happiness. A former patient, David, came to mind. David, a thirtyfour-year-old landscape architect, initially presented to my office with classic symptoms of a severe clinical depression."}, {"text": " He explained that his depression may have been triggered by some minor work-related stresses, but \u201cmostly it just kinda came on.\u201d We discussed the option of an antidepressant medication, which he was in favor of, and we instituted a trial of a standard antidepressant. The medication proved to be very effective, and within three weeks his acute symptoms improved and he was back to his normal routine."}, {"text": " In exploring his history, however, it didn\u2019t take long to realize that in addition to his acute depression, he also suffered from  \fdysthymia, a more insidious form of chronic lowgrade depression that had been present for many years.

Several months later, David returned to my office: \u201cI\u2019ve been miserable,\u201d he said with a dejected tone."}, {"text": " \u201cLast time I saw you, things were going so great. I really thought that I had found my ideal mate. I even brought up the subject of marriage. But it seemed that the closer I wanted to  \fbecome, the more she pulled away. She finally broke up with me. I got really depressed again for a couple of weeks after that."}, {"text": " I even started calling her and hanging up just to hear her voice, and driving by her work just to see if her car was there. After about a month I got sick of doing that\u2014it was just so ridiculous\u2014and at least my symptoms of depression got better.

The ancient concept of Eros, with the underlying sense of becoming one, of fusion with another, has taken on new meaning. Romance has acquired an artificial quality, with flavors of fraudulence and deception, the quality that had led Oscar Wilde to bleakly observe, \u201cWhen one is in love, one always begins by deceiving oneself, and one always ends up by deceiving others."}, {"text": " That is what the world calls a romance.\u201d Earlier, we explored the role of closeness and intimacy as an important component of human happiness. There\u2019s no doubt of this. But if one is looking for lasting satisfaction in a relationship, the foundation of that relationship must be solid. It is for this reason that the Dalai Lama encourages us to examine the underlying basis of  \fa relationship, should we find ourselves in a relationship that is going sour."}, {"text": " Sexual attraction, or even the intense feeling of falling in love, may play a role in forming an initial bond between two people, to draw them together, but like a good epoxy glue, that initial bonding agent needs to be mixed with other ingredients before it will harden into a lasting bond. In identifying these other ingredients, we turn once again to the Dalai Lama\u2019s approach to building a strong relationship \u2014bas\u2014ing our relationship on the qualities of affection, compassion, and mutual respect as human beings."}, {"text": " Basing a relationship on these qualities enables us to achieve a deep and meaningful bond not only with our lover or spouse but also with friends, acquaintances, or strangers\u2014virtually any human being. It opens up unlimited possibilities and opportunities for  \fconnection.  \fChapter 7  THE VALUE AND BENEFITS OF COMPASSION  \fDEFINING COMPASSION  As our conversations progressed, I discovered that the devel- A opment of compassion plays a far greater role in the Dalai Lama\u2019s life than simply a means to cultivating a feeling of warmth and affection, a means of improving our relationship with others."}, {"text": " It became clear, in fact, that as a practicing Buddhist, the development of compassion was an integral part of his spiritual path. \u201cGiven the importance that Buddhism places on compassion as an essential part of one\u2019s spiritual development,\u201d I asked, \u201ccan you more clearly define what you mean by \u2018compassion\u2019?\u201d The Dalai Lama replied, \u201cCompassion can be  \froughly defined in terms of a state of mind that is nonviolent, nonharming, and nonaggressive."}, {"text": " It is a mental attitude based on the wish for others to be free of their suffering and is associated with a sense of commitment, responsibility, and respect towards the other. \u201cIn discussing the definition of compassion, the Tibetan word Tse-wa, there is also a sense to the word of its being a state of mind that can include a wish for good things for oneself."}, {"text": " In developing compassion, perhaps one could begin with the wish that oneself be free of suffering, and then take that natural feeling towards oneself and cultivate it, enhance it, and extend it out o include and embrace others. \u201cNow, when people speak of compassion, I think that there is often a danger of confusing compassion with attachment."}, {"text": " So when we  \fdiscuss compassion, we must first make a distinction between two types of love or compassion. One kind of compassion is tinged with attachment\u2014the feeling of controlling someone, or loving someone so that person will love you back. This ordinary type of love or compassion is quite partial and biased."}, {"text": " And a relationship based on that alone is unstable. That kind of partial relationship, based on perceiving and identifying the person as a friend, may lead to a certain emotional attachment and feeling of closeness. But if there is a slight change in the situation, a disagreement perhaps, or if your friend does something to make you angry, then all of a sudden your mental projection changes; the concept of\u2018my friend\u2019 is no longer there."}, {"text": " Then you\u2019ll find the emotional attachment evaporating, and instead of that feeling of love and concern,  \fyou may have a feeling of hatred. So, that kind of love, based on attachment, can be closely linked with hatred. \u201cBut there is a second type of compassion that is free from such attachment."}, {"text": " That is genuine compassion. That kind of compassion isn\u2019t so much based on the fact that this person or that person is dear to me. Rather, genuine compassion is based on the rationale that all human beings have an innate desire to be happy and overcome suffering, just like myself. And, just like myself, they have the natural right to fulfill this fundamental aspiration."}, {"text": " On the basis of the recognition of this equality and commonality, you develop a sense of affinity and closeness with others. With this as a foundation, you can feel compassion regardless of whether you view the other person as a friend or an enemy. It is based  \fon the other\u2019s fundamental rights rather than your own mental projection."}, {"text": " Upon this basis, then, you will generate love and compassion. That\u2019s genuine compassion. \u201cSo, one can see how making the distinction between these two kinds of compassion and cultivating genuine compassion can be quite important in our day-to-day life. For instance, in marriage there is generally a component of emotional attachment."}, {"text": " But I think that if there is a component of genuine compassion as well, based on mutual respect as two human beings, the marriage tends to last a long time. In the case of emotional attachment without compassion, the marriage is more unstable and tends to end more quickly.\u201d The idea of developing a different kind of compassion, a more universal compassion, a kind  \fof generic compassion divorced from personal feeling, seemed like a tall order."}, {"text": " Turning it over in my mind, as if thinking aloud, I asked, \u201cBut love or compassion is a subjective feeling. It seems that the emotional tone or feeling of love or compassion would be the same whether it was \u2018tinged with attachment\u2019 or \u2019genuine.\u2018 So if the person would experience the same emotion or feeling in both types, why is it important to distinguish between the two?\u201d With a decisive tone, the Dalai Lama answered, \u201cFirst, I think that there is a different quality between the feeling of genuine love, or compassion, and love based on attachment."}, {"text": " It\u2019s not the same feeling. The feeling of genuine compassion is much stronger, much wider; it has a very profound quality. Also, genuine love and compassion are much more stable, more reliable.  \fFor example, if you see an animal intensely suffering, like a fish writhing with a hook in its mouth, you might spontaneously experience a feeling of not being able to bear its pain."}, {"text": " That feeling isn\u2019t based on a special connection with that particular animal, a feeling of\u2018Oh, that animal is my friend.\u2019 In that case you\u2019re basing your compassion simply on the fact that that being also has feeling, can experience pain, and has a right not to experience such pain. So, that type of compassion, not mixed with desire or attachment, is much more sound, and more durable in the long run."}, {"text": "\u201d Moving deeper into the subject of compassion, I continued, \u201cNow in your example of seeing a fish intensely suffering with a hook in its mouth, you bring up a vital point\u2014that it is associated with a feeling of not being able to bear  \fits pain.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said the Dalai Lama. \u201cIn fact, in one sense one could define compassion as the feeling of unbearableness at the sight of other people\u2019s suffering, other sentient being\u2019s suffering."}, {"text": " And in order to generate that feeling one must first have an appreciation of the seriousness or intensity of another\u2019s suffering. So, I think that the more fully one understands suffering, and the various kinds of suffering that we are subject to, the deeper will be one\u2019s level of compassion.\u201d I raised the question, \u201cWell, I appreciate the fact that greater awareness of other\u2019s suffering can enhance our capacity for compassion."}, {"text": " In fact, by definition, compassion involves opening oneself to another\u2019s suffering. Sharing another\u2019s suffering. But there\u2019s a more basic question: Why would we want to take on another\u2019s suffering  \fwhen we don\u2019t even want our own? I mean, most of us go to great lengths to avoid our own pain and suffering, even to the point of taking drugs and so on."}, {"text": " Why would we then deliberately take on someone else\u2019s suffering?\u201d Without hesitation the Dalai Lama responded, \u201cI feel that there is a significant difference between your own suffering and the suffering you might experience in a compassionate state in which you take upon yourself and share other people\u2019s suffering\u2014a qualitative difference."}, {"text": "\u201d He paused, and then as if effortlessly targeting my own feelings at the moment, he continued, \u201cWhen you think about your own suffering, there is a feeling of being totally overwhelmed. There is a sense of being burdened, of being pressed under something\u2014a feeling of helplessness. There\u2019s a dullness, almost as if your faculties have become  \fnumb."}, {"text": " \u201cNow, in generating compassion, when you are taking on another\u2019s suffering, you may also initially experience a certain degree of discomfort, a sense of uncomfortableness or unbearableness. But in the case of compassion, the feeling is much different; underlying the uncomfortable feeling is a very high level of alertness and determination because you are voluntarily and deliberately accepting another\u2019s suffering for a higher purpose."}, {"text": " There is a feeling of connectedness and commitment, a willingness to reach out to others, a feeling of freshness rather than dullness. This is similar to the case of an athlete. While undergoing rigorous training, an athlete may suffer a lot\u2014 working out, sweating, straining. I think it can be quite a painful and exhausting experience."}, {"text": " But the athlete doesn\u2019t see it as a painful experience. The  \fathlete would take it as a great accomplishment, an experience associated with a sense of joy. But if the same person were subject to some other physical work that was not part of his athletic training, then the athlete would think, \u2018Oh, why have I been subjected to this terrible ordeal?\u2019 So the mental attitude makes a tremendous difference."}, {"text": "\u201d These few words, spoken with such conviction, lifted me from an oppressed feeling to one of a feeling of the possibility of the resolution of suffering, of transcending suffering. \u201cYou mention that the first step in generating that kind of compassion is an appreciation of suffering. But are there any other specific Buddhist techniques used to enhance one\u2019s compassion?\u201d \u201cYes."}, {"text": " For example in the Mahayana tradition  \fof Buddhism we find two principal techniques for cultivating compassion. These are known as the\u2018seven-point cause-and-effect\u2019 method and the \u2019exchange and equality of oneself with others.\u2018 The \u2019exchange-and-equality\u2019 method is the technique that you\u2019ll find in the eighth chapter of Shantideva\u2019s Guide to the Bodhisattuas Way of Life."}, {"text": " But,\u201d he said, glancing at his watch and realizing that our time was running out, \u201cI think that we will practice some exercises or meditations on compassion during the public talks later this week.\u201d With this, he smiled warmly and rose to end our session.  \fTHE REAL VATUE OF HUMAN LIFE  Continuing our discussion of compassion in our next conversation, I began, \u201cNow, we\u2019ve been speaking about the importance of compassion, about your belief that human affection, warmth, friendship, and so on are conditions absolutely necessary for happiness."}, {"text": " But I\u2019m just wondering\u2014suppose, let\u2019s say, a wealthy businessman came to you and said, \u2018Your Holiness, you say that warmth and compassion are crucial for one to be happy. But by nature I\u2019m just not a very warm or affectionate person. To be honest I really don\u2019t  \ffeel particularly compassionate or altruistic."}, {"text": " I tend to be a rather rational, practical, and perhaps intellectual person, and I just don\u2019t feel those kinds of emotions. Yet, I feel good about my life, I feel happy with my life the way it is. I have a very successful business, friends, and I provide for my wife and children and seem to have a good relationship with them."}, {"text": " I just don\u2019t feel that anything is missing. Developing compassion, altruism, warmth, and so on sounds nice, but for me, what\u2019s the point? It just seems so sentimental ...\u201d\u2019 \u201cFirst of all,\u201d the Dalai Lama replied, \u201cif a person said that, I would still have doubts whether that person was really happy deep down."}, {"text": " I truly believe that compassion provides the basis of human survival, the real value of human life, and without that there is a basic piece  \fmissing. A deep sensitivity to other\u2019s feelings is an element of love and compassion, and without that, for example, I think there would be problems in the man\u2019s ability to relate with his wife."}, {"text": " If the person really had that attitude of indifference to other\u2019s suffering and feelings, then even if he was a billionaire, had a good education, had no problems with his family or children, and was surrounded with friends, other rich businesspeople, politicians, and leaders of nations, I think that in spite of all these things that the effect of all these positive things would just remain on the surface."}, {"text": " \u201cBut if he continued to maintain that he didn\u2019t feel compassion, yet he didn\u2019t feel anything missing ... then it might be a little bit difficult to help him understand the importance of compassion ...\u201d  \fThe Dalai Lama stopped speaking for a moment to reflect. His intermittent pauses, which occurred throughout our conversations, did not seem to create an awkward silence; rather, they were like a gravitational force, gathering greater weight and meaning to his words when the conversation resumed."}, {"text": " Finally, he continued, \u201cStill, even if that was the case, there are several things that I could point out. First, I might suggest that he reflect on his own experience. He can see that if someone treats him with compassion and affection, then it makes him feel happy. So, on the basis of that experience, it would help him realize that other people also feel good when they are shown warmth and compassion."}, {"text": " Therefore, recognizing this fact might make him more respectful of other people\u2019s emotional sensitivity and make him  \fmore inclined to give them compassion and warmth. At the same time he would discover that the more you give others warmth, the more warmth you receive. I don\u2019t think that it would take him very long to realize that."}, {"text": " And as a result, this becomes the basis of mutual trust and friendship. \u201cNow suppose this man had all these material facilities, was successful in life, surrounded by friends, financially secure, and so on. I think it is even possible that his family and children might relate to him and experience a kind of contentment because the man is successful and they have plenty of money and a comfortable life."}, {"text": " I think that it is conceivable that up to a certain point, even without feeling human warmth and affection, he may not experience a feeling of lacking something. But if he felt that everything  \fwas OK, that there was no real requirement for developing compassion, I would suggest that this view is due to ignorance and shortsightedness."}, {"text": " Even if it appeared that others were relating to him quite fully, in reality what is happening is that much of the people\u2019s relationship or interaction with him is based on theirperception ofhim as a successful, wealthy resource. They may be influenced by his wealth and power and relate to that rather than to the person himself."}, {"text": " So in some sense, although they may not receive human warmth and affection from him, they may be contented; they may not expect more. But what happens is if his fortune declined, then that basis of the relationship would weaken. Then he would begin to see the effect of not having warmth and immediately begin to suffer."}, {"text": " \u201cHowever, if people have compassion,  \fnaturally that\u2019s something they can count on; even if they have economic problems and their fortune declines, they still have something to share with fellow human beings. World economies are always so tenuous and we are subject to so many losses in life, but a compassionate attitude is something that we can always carry with us."}, {"text": "\u201d A maroon-robed attendant entered the room and silently poured tea, as the Dalai Lama continued, \u201cOf course, in attempting to explain to someone the importance of compassion, in some cases, you might be dealing with a very hardened, individualistic, and selfish person, someone concerned only with her or his own interests."}, {"text": " And it is even possible that there are people who may not have the capacity to empathize with even someone whom they love or who may be close to them. But even to such  \fpeople, it is still possible to present the importance of compassion and love on the grounds that it\u2019s the best way to fulfill their selfinterests."}, {"text": " They wish to have good health, live a longer life, and have peace of mind, happiness, and joy. And if these are things that they desire, I\u2019ve heard that there is even scientific evidence that these things can be enhanced by feelings of love and compassion ... But as a doctor, a psychiatrist, perhaps you would know better about these scientific claims?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d I agreed."}, {"text": " \u201cI think there is definitely supporting scientific evidence to back up the claims about the physical and emotional benefits of compassionate states of mind.\u201d \u201cSo I think that educating someone about these facts and scientific studies couldcertainly encourage some people to cultivate a more  \fcompassionate state of mind ."}, {"text": ".. ,\u201d the Dalai Lama commented. \u201cBut I think that even aside from these scientific studies, there are other arguments that people could understand and appreciate from their own practical or direct everyday experience. For example, you could point out that lack of compassion leads to a certain ruthlessness."}, {"text": " There are many examples indicating that at some level deep down, ruthless people generally suffer from a kind of unhappiness and discontent, people like Stalin and Hitler.

And resolve that you will help that person to be relieved from their suffering. Finally, place your mind single-pointedly on that kind of conclusion or resolution, and for the last few minutes of the meditation try to simply generate your mind in a compassionate or loving state."}, {"text": "\u201d  With that, the Dalai Lama assumed a crosslegged meditation posture, remaining completely immobile as he practiced the meditation along with the audience.

The woman promised to procure it for him, but as she was leaving, he added, \u201cI require the mustard seed be taken from a household where no child, spouse, parent, or servant has died."}, {"text": "\u201d  \fThe woman agreed and began going from house to house in search of the mustard seed. At each house the people agreed to give her the seed, but when she asked them if anyone had died in that household, she could find no home where death had not visited\u2014in one house a daughter, in another a servant, in others a husband or parent had died."}, {"text": " Kisagotami was not able to find a home free from the suffering of death. Seeing she was not alone in her grief, the mother let go of her child\u2019s lifeless body and returned to the Buddha, who said with great compassion, \u201cYou thought that you alone had lost a son; the law of death is that among all living creatures there is no permanence."}, {"text": "\u201d  \fKisagotami\u2019s search taught her that no one lives free from suffering and loss.

Human beings have devised a vast repertoire of strategies for avoiding having to experience suffering. Sometimes we use external means, such as chemicals\u2014deadening and medicating our emotional pain with drugs or alcohol."}, {"text": " We have an array of internal mechanisms as well\u2014 psychological defenses, often unconscious, that buffer us from feeling too much emotional pain and anguish when we are confronted with  \fproblems. Sometimes these defense mechanisms can be quite primitive, such as simply refusing to recognize that a problem exists."}, {"text": " At other times, we may vaguely recognize that we have a problem but immerse ourselves in a million distractions or entertainments to avoid thinking about it.

One year later, however, shortly after the anniversary of his father\u2019s death, Randall began to spiral into a severe depression."}, {"text": " He came to see me and explained, \u201cI just can\u2019t understand what is causing this depression. Everything seems to be going well right now. It can\u2019t be the death of my father; he died over a year ago, and I\u2019ve already come to terms with his death.\u201d With very little therapy it became clear, however, that in struggling to keep a tight reign on his emotions, in order to \u201cbe strong,\u201d he had never fully dealt with his feelings of loss and grief."}, {"text": " These feelings continued to grow until finally manifesting as an overpowering depression that he was forced to deal with.  \fIn Randall\u2019s case, his depression lifted rather quickly as we focused on his pain and feelings of loss, and he was able to fully confront and experience his grief. Sometimes, however, our unconscious strategies to avoid facing our problems are more deep-seated\u2014deeply ingrained coping mechanisms that can become embedded in our personality and are hard to extract."}, {"text": " Most of us know a friend, acquaintance, or family member, for example, who avoids problems by projecting onto others and blaming them\u2014accusing others of having faults that, in fact, are his or her own.

In our daily lives problems are bound to arise."}, {"text": " The biggest problems in our lives are the ones that we inevitably have to face, like old age, illness, and death.

That\u2019s pretty tough to face."}, {"text": "\u201d  \f\u201cBut I think it\u2019s still better to face it,\u201d he replied with a martial spirit. \u201cFor example, you might consider things like old age and death as negative, unwanted, and simply try to forget about them. But eventually these things will come anyway. And if you\u2019ve avoided thinking about these things, when the day comes that any of these events occur, it will come as a shock causing an unbearable mental uneasiness."}, {"text": " However, if you spend some time thinking about old age, death, and these other unfortunate things, your mind will be much more stable when these things happen as you have already become acquainted with these problems and kinds of suffering and have anticipated that they will occur. \u201cThat\u2019s why I believe it can be useful to prepare yourself ahead of time by familiarizing  \fyourself with the kinds of suffering you might encounter."}, {"text": " To use the battle analogy again, reflecting on suffering could be seen as a military exercise.

But you should not forget the fact that this does not alleviate the situation. It may help you mentally cope with it, reduce the fear and so on, but it does not alleviate the problem itself. For instance, if a child with a birth defect is going to be born, no matter how strongly you thought about it ahead of time, you still have to find a way to handle it."}, {"text": " So this is still difficult.\u201d As he said this there was a note of sadness in his voice\u2014more than a note, perhaps a chord. But the underlying melody was not one of  \fhopelessness. For a full minute, the Dalai Lama stopped speaking once again, gazing out the window as if looking out onto the world at large, then continued, \u201cThere\u2019s really no avoiding the fact that suffering is part of life."}, {"text": " And of course we have a natural tendency to dislike our suffering and problems. But I think that ordinarily people don\u2019t view the very nature of our existence to be characterized by suffering ...\u201d The Dalai Lama suddenly began to laugh, \u201cI mean on your birthday people usually say, \u2018Happy Birthday!,\u2019 when actually the day of your birth was the birth of your suffering."}, {"text": " But nobody says, \u2018Happy Birth-of-Sufferingday!\u201d he joked. \u201cIn accepting that suffering is part of your daily existence, you could begin by examining the factors that normally give rise to feelings of discontent and mental unhappiness. Generally  \fspeaking, for instance, you feel happy if you or people close to you receive praise, fame, fortune, and other pleasant things."}, {"text": " And you feel unhappy and discontent if you don\u2019t achieve these things or if your rival is receiving them. If you look at your normal day-to day life, however, you often find that there are so many factors and conditions that cause pain, suffering, and feelings of dissatisfaction, whereas the conditions that give rise to joy and happiness are comparatively rare."}, {"text": " This is something that we have to undergo, whether we like it or not. And since this is the reality of our existence, our attitude towards suffering may need to be modified. Our attitude towards suffering becomes very important because it can affect how we cope with suffering when it arises. Now, our usual attitude consists of an intense aversion and  \fintolerance of our pain and suffering."}, {"text": " However, if we can transform our attitude towards suffering, adopt an attitude that allows us greater tolerance of it, then this can do much to help counteract feelings of mental unhappiness, dissatisfaction, and discontent. \u201cFor me personally, the strongest and most effective practice to help tolerate suffering is to see and understand that suffering is the underlying nature of Samsara,4 of unenlightened exis ence."}, {"text": " Now when you experience some physical pain or other problem, of course at that moment there is a feeling of \u2018Oh! This suffering is so bad!\u2019 There\u2019s a feeling of rejection associated with the suffering, a kind of feeling of \u2018Oh, I shouldn\u2019t be experiencing this.\u2019But at that moment if you can look at the situation from another angle and realize that this very body."}, {"text": "..,\u201c he slapped an arm  \fin demonstration, \u201dis the very basis of suffering, then this reduces that feeling of rejection\u2014that feeling that somehow you don\u2019t deserve to suffer, that you are a victim. So, once you understand and accept this reality, then you experience suffering as something that is quite natural."}, {"text": " \u201cSo, for example, when dealing with the suffering the Tibetan people have undergone, in one way you could look at the situation and feel overwhelmed, wondering, \u2018How in the world has this happened?\u2019 But from another angle you could reflect on the fact that Tibet also is in the middle of Samsara,\u201d he laughed, \u201cas is this planet and the whole galaxy."}, {"text": "\u201d He laughed again. \u201cSo, anyway, I think that how you perceive life as a whole plays a role in your attitude about suffering. For instance, if your basic outlook is that suffering is negative and must be avoided at  \fall costs and in some sense is a sign of failure, this will add a distinct psychological component of anxiety and intolerance when you encounter difficult circumstances, a feeling of being overwhelmed."}, {"text": " On the other hand, if your basic outlook accepts that suffering is a natural part of your existence, this will undoubtedly make you more tolerant towards the adversities of life. And without a certain degree of tolerance towards your suffering, your life becomes miserable; then it\u2019s like having a very bad night."}, {"text": " That night seems eternal; it never seems to end.\u201d \u201cIt seems to me that when you speak about the underlying nature of existence as being characterized by suffering, as basically unsatisfactory, that sounds like a pretty pessimistic view, really discouraging in fact,\u201d I noted.  \fThe Dalai Lama quickly clarified, \u201cWhen I speak of the unsatisfactory nature of existence, one needs to understand that this is in the context of the overall Buddhist path."}, {"text": " These reflections have to be understood in their proper context, which is within the framework of the Buddhist path. Unless this view of suffering is seen in its proper context, I agree that there is a danger, or even a likelihood, of misunderstanding this type of approach as being rather pessimistic and negative."}, {"text": " Consequently, it\u2019s important to understand the basic Buddhist stance towards the whole issue of suffering. We find that in Buddha\u2019s own public teachings, the first thing he taught was the principle of the Four Noble Truths, the first of which is the Truth of Suffering. And here, a lot of emphasis is placed on the realization of the suffering nature of one\u2019s existence."}, {"text": "  \f\u201cThe point that has to be borne in mind is that the reason why reflection on suffering is so important is because there is a possibility of a way out; there is an alternative. There is a Possibility of freedom from suffering. By removing the causes of suffering, it is possible to attain a state of Liberation, a state free from suffering."}, {"text": " According to Buddhist thought, the root causes of suffering are ignorance, craving, and hatred. These are called the \u2018three poisons of the mind.\u2019These terms have specific connotations when used within a Buddhist context. For example, \u2018ignorance\u2019 doesn\u2019t refer to a lack of information as it is used in an everyday sense but rather refers to a fundamental misperception of the true nature of the self and all phenomena."}, {"text": " By generating insight into the true nature of reality and eliminating afflictive states of mind such as  \fcraving and hatred, one can achieve a completely purified state of mind, free from suffering. Within a Buddhist context, when one reflects on the fact that one\u2019s ordinary day-to-day existence is characterized by suffering, this serves to encourage one to engage in the practices that will eliminate the root causes of one\u2019s suffering."}, {"text": " Otherwise, if there was no hope, or no possibility of freedom from suffering, mere reflection on suffering just becomes morbid thinking, and would be quite negative.\u201d  As he spoke, I began to sense how reflecting on our \u201csuffering nature\u201d could play a role in accepting life\u2019s inevitable sorrows and could even  \fbe a valuable method of putting our daily problems in proper perspective."}, {"text": " And I began to perceive how suffering might even be seen in a wider context, as part of a greater spiritual path, particularly in view of the Buddhist paradigm, which recognizes the possibility of purifying the mind and ultimately achieving a state in which there is no more suffering. But, turning away from these grand philosophical speculations, I was curious to learn how the Dalai Lama dealt with suffering on a more personal level, how he handled the loss of a loved one, for instance."}, {"text": " When I first visited Dharamsala many years ago, I had gotten to know the Dalai Lama\u2019s older brother, Lobsang Samden. I became quite fond of him and was saddened to hear of his sudden death a few years back.

I mean was there something in particular that helped you get over it?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said pensively."}, {"text": " \u201cI felt that feeling of sadness for some weeks, but that feeling gradually lifted. Still, there was a feeling of regret ...\u201d \u201cRegret?\u201d \u201cYes. I was gone at the time he died, and I think if I had been there, maybe there was something I could have done to help. So I have this feeling of regret."}, {"text": "\u201d  \fA lifetime of contemplating the inevitability of human suffering may have played a role in helping the Dalai Lama accept his loss, but it did not create a cold emotionless individual with grim resignation in the face of suffering\u2014the sadness in his voice revealed a man with deep human feeling."}, {"text": " At the same time, his candor and frankness of manner, completely devoid of selfpity or self-recrimination, created the unmistakable impression of a man who had fully accepted his loss. On that day, our conversation had lasted well into the late afternoon.

Yet I hoped to question him in greater detail  \fabout the issue of loss, to see if he had additional advice about how to survive the death of a loved one, other than simply accepting the inevitability of human suffering."}, {"text": " As I was about to expand on the subject, however, he appeared somewhat distracted, and I noticed a cast of weariness around his eyes. Shortly, his secretary quietly entered the room and gave me The Look: honed by years of practice, it indicated that it was time to leave. \u201cYes ... ,\u201d the Dalai Lama said apologetically, \u201cperhaps we should close ."}, {"text": ".. I\u2019m a bit tired.\u201d The next day, before I had an opportunity to return to the subject in our private conversations, the issue was raised in his public talk. An audience member, clearly in pain, asked the Dalai Lama, \u201cDo you have any suggestions about how to handle a great personal loss, such as the loss  \fof a child?\u201d With a gentle tone of compassion, he answered, \u201cTo some degree, that depends on people\u2019s personal beliefs."}, {"text": " If people believe in rebirth, then accordingly, I think there is some way to reduce sorrow or worry. They can take consolation in the fact that their loved one will be reborn. \u201cFor those people who do not believe in rebirth, then I think there are still some simple ways to help deal with the loss."}, {"text": " First, they could reflect that if they worried too much, allowing themselves to be too overwhelmed by the sense of loss and sorrow, and if they carried on with that feeling of being overwhelmed, not only would it be very destructive and harmful to themselves, ruining their health, but also it would not have any benefit to the person who has  \fpassed away."}, {"text": " \u201cFor example, in my own case, I have lost my most respected tutor, my mother, and also one of my brothers. When they passed away, of course, I felt very, very sad. Then I constantly kept thinking that it\u2019s no use to worry too much, and if I really loved these people, then I must fulfill their wishes with a calm mind."}, {"text": " So I try my best to do that. So I think if you\u2019ve lost someone who is very dear to you, that\u2019s the proper way to approach it. You see, the best way to keep a memory of that person, the best remembrance, is to see if you can carry on the wishes of that person. \u201cInitially, of course, feelings of grief and anxiety are a natural human response to a loss."}, {"text": " But if you allow these feelings of loss and worry to persist, there\u2019s a danger; if these feelings are  \fleft unchecked, they can lead to a kind of selfabsorption. A situation where the focus becomes your own self. And when that happens you become overwhelmed by the sense of loss, and you get a feeling that it\u2019s only you who is going through this."}, {"text": " Depression sets in. But in reality, there are others who will be going through the same kind of experience. So, if you find yourself worrying too much, it may help to think of the other people who have similar or even worse tragedies. Once you realize that, then you no longer feel isolated, as if you have been singlepointedly picked out."}, {"text": " That can offer you some kind of condolence.\u201d  \fAlthough pain and suffering are experienced by all human beings, I have often felt that those brought up in some Eastern cultures appear to have a greater acceptance and tolerance for suffering. Part of this may be due to their beliefs, but perhaps it is because suffering is more visible in poorer nations such as India than it is in wealthier countries."}, {"text": " Hunger, poverty, illness, and death are in plain view. When a person becomes old or sick, they aren\u2019t marginalized, shipped off to nursing homes to be cared for by health professionals\u2014they remain in the community, to be cared for by the family. Those living in daily contact with the realities of life cannot easily deny that life is characterized by suffering, that it is a natural part of existence."}, {"text": " As Western society gained the ability to limit the suffering caused by harsh living conditions, it  \fseems to have lost the ability to cope with the suffering that remains. Studies by social scientists have emphasized that most people in modern Western society tend to go through life believing that the world is basically a nice place in which to live, that life is mostly fair, and that they are good people who deserve to have good things happen to them."}, {"text": " These beliefs can play an important role in leading a happier and healthier life. But the inevitable arising of suffering undermines these beliefs and can make it difficult to go on living happily and effectively. In this context, a relatively minor trauma can have a massive psychological impact as one loses faith in one\u2019s basic beliefs about the world as fair and benevolent."}, {"text": " As a result, suffering is intensified. There\u2019s no doubt that with growing technology, the general level of physical comfort  \fhas improved for many in Western society. It is at this point that a critical shift in perception takes place; as suffering becomes less visible, it is no longer seen as part of the fundamental nature of human beings\u2014but rather as an anomaly, a sign that something has gone terribly wrong, a sign of \u201cfailure\u201d of some system, an infringement on our guaranteed right to happiness! This kind of thinking poses hidden dangers."}, {"text": " If we think of suffering as something unnatural, something that we shouldn\u2019t be experiencing, then it\u2019s not much of a leap to begin to look for someone to blame for our suffering. If I\u2019m unhappy, then I must be the \u201cvictim\u201d of someone or something\u2014an idea that\u2019s all to common in the West."}, {"text": " The victimizer may be the government, the educational system, abusive parents, a \u201cdysfunctional family,\u201d the other gender, or our  \funcaring mate. Or we may turn blame inward: there\u2019s something wrong with me, I\u2019m the victim of disease, of defective genes perhaps. But the risk of continuing to focus on assigning blame and maintaining a victim stance, is the perpetuation of our suffering\u2014with persistent feelings of anger, frustration, and resentment."}, {"text": " Of course, the wish to get free of suffering is the legitimate goal of every human being. It is the corollary of our wish to be happy. Thus it is entirely appropriate that we seek out the causes of our unhappiness and do whatever we can to alleviate our problems, searching for solutions on all levels\u2014global, societal, familial, and individual."}, {"text": " But as long as we view suffering as an unnatural state, an abnormal condition that we fear, avoid, and reject, we will never uproot the causes of suffering and begin to live a happier life.  \fChapter 9  SELF-CREATED SUFFERING  On his initial visit, the well-groomed middle-aged gentleman, elegantly dressed in an austere black Armani suit, sat down in a polite yet reserved manner and began to relate what had brought him  \finto the office."}, {"text": " He spoke rather softly, in a controlled, measured voice.

EX-wife, now. She was having an affair behind my back! And after everything I did for her."}, {"text": " That little ... that little ... SLUT!\u201d His voice became louder, more angry, and more venomous, as for the next twenty minutes he recounted grievance after grievance against his ex-wife. Our time was coming to a close.

We explored, for instance, how the refusal to accept suffering as a natural part of life can lead to viewing oneself as a perpetual victim and blaming others for our problems\u2014a surefire recipe for a miserable life. But we also add to our own suffering in other ways."}, {"text": " All too often we perpetuate our pain, keep  \fit alive, by replaying our hurts over and over again in our minds, magnifying our injustices in the process. We repeat our painful memories with the unconscious wish perhaps that somehow it will change the situation\u2014but it never does. Of course, sometimes this endless recounting of our woes can serve a limited purpose; it can add drama and a certain excitement to our lives or elicit attention and sympathy from others."}, {"text": " But this seems like a poor trade-off for the unhappiness we continue to endure. In speaking about how we add to our own suffering, the Dalai Lama explained, \u201cWe can see that there are many ways in which we actively contribute to our own experience of mental unrest and suffering. Although, in general, mental and emotional afflictions themselves can come naturally, often it is our own reinforcement of  \fthose negative emotions that makes them so much worse."}, {"text": " For instance when we have anger or hatred towards a person, there is less likelihood of its developing to a very intense degree if we leave it unattended. However, if we think about the projected injustices done to us, the ways in which we have been unfairly treated, and we keep on thinking about them over and over, then that feeds the hatred."}, {"text": " It makes the hatred very powerful and intense. Of course, the same can apply to when we have an attachment towards a particular person; we can feed that by thinking about how beautiful he or she is, and as we keep thinking about the projected qualities that we see in the person, the attachment becomes more and more intense."}, {"text": " But this shows how through constant familiarity and thinking, we ourselves can make our emotions more intense  \fand powerful. \u201cWe also often add to our pain and suffering by being overly sensitive, overreacting to minor things, and sometimes taking things too personally. We tend to take small things too seriously and blow them up out of proportion, while at the same time we often remain indifferent to the really important things, those things which have profound effects on our lives and long-term consequences and implications."}, {"text": " \u201cSo I think that to a large extent, whether you suffer depends on how you respond to a given situation. For example, say that you find out that someone is speaking badly of you behind your back. If you react to this knowledge that someone is speaking badly of you, this negativity, with a feeling of hurt or anger, then you yourself destroy your own peace of mind."}, {"text": " Your pain is  \fyour own personal creation. On the other hand, if you refrain from reacting in a negative way, let the slander pass by you as if it were a silent wind passing behind your ears, you protect yourself from that feeling of hurt, that feeling of agony. So, although you may not always be able to avoid difficult situations, you can modify the extent to which you suffer by how you choose to respond to the situation."}, {"text": "\u201d  We also often add to our pain and suffering by being overly sensitive, overreacting to minor things, and sometimes taking things too personally ...\u201c With these words, the Dalai Lama recognizes the origin of many of the day-  \fto-day aggravations that can add up to be a major source of suffering."}, {"text": " Therapists sometimes call this process personalizing our pain\u2014the tendency to narrow our psychological field of vision by interpreting or misinterpreting everything that occurs in terms of its impact on us. One night I had dinner with a colleague at a restaurant. The service at the restaurant turned out to be very slow, and from the time we sat down, my colleague began to complain: \u201cLook at that! That waiter is so damn slow! Where is he? I think he\u2019s purposely ignoring us!\u201d Although neither of us had pressing engagements, my colleague\u2019s complaints about the slow service continued to escalate throughout the meal and expanded into a litany of complaints about the food, tableware, and anything else that was not to his liking."}, {"text": " At the end of the meal, the  \fwaiter presented us with two free desserts, explaining, \u201cI apologize for the slow service this evening,\u201d he said sincerely, \u201cbut we\u2019re a little understaffed. One of the cooks had a death in the family and is off tonight, and one of the servers called in sick at the last minute."}, {"text": " I hope it didn\u2019t inconvenience you ...\u201d \u201cI\u2019m still never coming here again,\u201d my colleague muttered bitterly under his breath as the waiter walked off. This is only a minor illustration of how we contribute to our own suffering by personalizing every annoying situation, as if it were being intentionally perpetrated on us."}, {"text": " In this case, the net result was only a ruined meal, an hour of aggravation. But when this kind of thinking becomes a pervasive pattern of relating to the world and extends to every comment made by  \four family or friends, or even events in society at large, it can become a significant source of our misery."}, {"text": " In describing the wider implications of this kind of narrow thinking, Jacques Lusseyran once made an insightful observation. Lusseyran, blind from the age of eight, was a founder of a resistance group in World War II. Eventually, he was captured by the Germans and imprisoned in Buchenwald concentration camp."}, {"text": " In later recounting his experiences in the camps, Lusseyran stated, \u201c ... Unhappiness, I saw then, comes to each of us because we think ourselves at the center of the world, because we have the miserable conviction that we alone suffer to the point of unbearable intensity. Unhappiness is always to feel oneself imprisoned in one\u2019s own skin, in one\u2019s own brain."}, {"text": "\u201d  \f\u201cBUT IT\u2019S NOT FAIR!\u201d  In our daily life, problems invariably arise. But problems themselves do not automatically cause suffering. If we can directly address our problem and focus our energies on finding a solution, for instance, the problem can be transformed into a challenge. If we throw into the mix, however, a feeling that our problem is \u201cunfair,\u201d we add an additional ingredient that can become a powerful fuel in creating mental unrest and emotional suffering."}, {"text": " And now we not only have two problems instead of one, but that feeling of \u201cunfairness\u201d distracts us, consumes us, and robs us of the energy needed to solve the original problem.  \fRaising this issue with the Dalai Lama one morning, I asked, \u201cHow can we deal with the feeling of unfairness that so often seems to torture us when problems arise?\u201d The Dalai Lama replied, \u201cThere may be a variety of ways that one might deal with the feeling that one\u2019s suffering is unfair."}, {"text": " I\u2019ve already spoken of the importance of accepting suffering as a natural fact of human existence. And I think that in some ways Tibetans might be in a better position to accept the reality of these difficult situations, because they will say, \u2018Maybe it is because of my Karma in the past.\u2019 They will attribute it to negative actions committed in either this or a previous life, and so there is a greater degree of acceptance."}, {"text": " I have seen some families in our settlements in India, with very difficult situations\u2014living under very poor conditions, and  \fon top of that having children with both eyes blind or sometimes retarded. And somehow these poor ladies still manage to look after them, simply saying, \u2018This is due to their Karma; it is their fate."}, {"text": "\u2019 \u201cIn mentioning Karma, here I think that it is important to point out and understand that sometimes due to one\u2019s misunderstanding of the doctrine of Karma, there is a tendency to blame everything on Karma and try to exonerate oneself from the responsibility or from the need to take personal initiative."}, {"text": " One could quite easily say, \u2018This is due to my past Karma, my negative past Karma, and what can I do? I am helpless.\u2019 This is a totally wrong understanding of Karma, because although one\u2019s experiences are a consequence of one\u2019s past deeds, that does not mean that the individual has no choice or that  \fthere is no room for initiative to change, to bring about positive change."}, {"text": " And this is the same in all areas of life. One should not become passive and try to excuse oneself from having to take personal initiative on the grounds that everything is a result of Karma, because if one understands the concept of Karma properly, one will understand that Karma means \u2018action.\u2019 Karma is a very active process."}, {"text": " And when we talk of Karma, or action, it is the very action committed by an agent, in this case, ourselves, in the past. So what type of future will come about, to a large extent, lies within our own hands in the present. It will be determined by the kind of initiatives that we take now. \u201cSo, Karma should not be understood in terms of a passive, static kind of force but rather should be understood in terms of an active  \fprocess."}, {"text": " This indicates that there is an important role for the individual agent to play in determining the course of the Karmic process. For instance, even a simple act or a simple purpose, like fulfilling our needs for food ... In order to achieve that simple goal, we need an action on the part of ourselves."}, {"text": " We need to look for food, and then we need to eat it; this shows that even for the simplest act, even a simple goal is achieved through action ...\u201d \u201cWell, reducing the feeling of unfairness by accepting that it is a result of one\u2019s Karma may be effective for Buddhists,\u201d I interjected. \u201cBut what about those who don\u2019t believe in the doctrine of Karma? Many in the West for instance ."}, {"text": "..\u201d \u201cPeople who believe in the idea of a Creator, of God, may accept these difficult circumstances  \fmore easily by viewing them as part of God\u2019s creation or plan.

With this kind of approach, you can  \flook at the problem with the attitude \u2018If there\u2019s a way to fight the problem, then fight, even if you have to go to court!\u2019\u201d He laughed."}, {"text": " \u201cThen, if you find that there\u2019s no way to win, you can simply forget about it. \u201cAn objective analysis of difficult or problematic situations can be quite important, because with this approach you\u2019ll often discover that behind the scenes there may be other factors at play. For instance, if you feel that you\u2019re being treated unfairly by your boss at work, there may be other factors at play; he may be annoyed by something else, an argument with his wife that morning or something, and his behavior may have nothing to do with you personally, may not be specifically directed at you."}, {"text": " Of course, you must still face whatever the situation may be, but at least with this approach you may not have the  \fadditional anxiety that would come along with it.\u201d \u201cCould this kind of \u2018scientific\u2019 approach, in which one objectively analyzes a situation, also possibly help one to discover ways in which oneself may be contributing to the problem? And could that help reduce the feeling of unfairness associated with the difficult situation?\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d he responded enthusiastically."}, {"text": " \u201cThat would definitely make a difference. In general, if we carefully examine any given situation in a very unbiased and honest way, we will realize that to a large extent we are also responsible for the unfolding of events. \u201cFor instance, many people blamed the Gulf War on Saddam Hussein. Afterwards, on various occasions I expressed, \u2018That\u2019s not fair!\u2019 Under such circumstances, I really feel kind of sorry for Saddam Hussein."}, {"text": " Of course, he is a dictator, and  \fof course, there are many other bad things about him. If you look at the situation roughly, it\u2019s easy to place all the blame on him\u2014he\u2019s a dictator, totalitarian, and even his eyes look a little bit frightening!\u201d he laughed. \u201cBut without his army his capacity to harm is limited, and without military equipment that powerful army cannot function."}, {"text": " All this military equipment is not produced by itself from thin air! So, when we look at it like that, many nations are involved. \u201cSo,\u201d the Dalai Lama continued, \u201coften our normal tendency is to try to blame our problems on others, on external factors. Furthermore, we tend to look for one single cause, and then try to exonerate ourselves from the responsibility."}, {"text": " It seems that whenever there are intense emotions involved, there tends to be a disparity between how things appear and how they really are. In  \fthis case if you go further and analyze the situation very carefully, you\u2019ll see that Saddam Hussein is part of the source of the problem, one of the factors, but there are other contributing conditions as well."}, {"text": " Once you realize this, your earlier attitude that he is the only cause automatically falls away and the reality of the situation emerges. \u201cThis practice involves looking at things in a holistic way\u2014realizing that there are many events contributing to a situation. For example, our problem with the Chinese\u2014again, there is much contribution made by ourselves."}, {"text": " I think perhaps our generation may have contributed to the situation, but definitely our previous generations I think were very negligent, at least a few generations back. So I think we, as Tibetans, contributed to this tragic situation. It\u2019s not fair to  \fblame everything on China. But there are so many levels."}, {"text": " Of course, although we might be a contributing factor to a situation, that doesn\u2019t mean we are solely to blame. For example, Tibetans have never completely bowed down to Chinese oppression; there has been continued resistance. Because of this the Chinese developed a new policy\u2014transferring large masses of Chinese to Tibet so that the Tibetan population becomes insignificant, the Tibetans displaced, and the movement for freedom cannot be effective."}, {"text": " In this case we cannot say that the Tibetan resistance is to blame or is responsible for the Chinese policy.\u201d \u201cWhen you are looking for your own contribution to a situation, what about those situations that clearly aren\u2019t your own fault, that you have nothing to do with, even relatively  \finsignificant everyday situations, such as when someone intentionally lies to you?\u201d I asked."}, {"text": " \u201cOf course, I may initially feel a sense of disappointment when somebody isn\u2019t truthful, but even here, if I examine the situation, I might discover that in fact their motive for hiding something from me may not be the result of a bad motive. It may be that they simply have a certain lack of confidence in me."}, {"text": " So sometimes when I feel disappointed by these kinds of incidents, I try to look at them from another angle; I\u2019ll think that maybe the person did not want to fully confide in me because I won\u2019t be able to keep it secret. My nature usually tends to be quite straightforward, so, because of this, the person might have decided that I\u2019m not the right person who can keep the secrets, that I may not be able to keep secrets as many people would expect."}, {"text": " In other  \fwords, I am not worthy of the person\u2019s full trust because of my personal nature. So, looking at it in that way, I would consider the cause to be due to my own fault.\u201d  Even coming from the Dalai Lama, this rationale seemed like a bit of a stretch\u2014finding \u201cyour own contribution\u201d to another\u2019s dishonesty."}, {"text": " But there was a genuine sincerity in his voice as he spoke, which suggested that in fact this was a technique he had used to practical advantage in his personal life to help deal with adversity. In applying this technique to our own lives, of course, we might not always be so successful in finding our own contribution to a problematic situation."}, {"text": " But whether we are successful or not, even the honest attempt to search for our own  \fcontribution to a problem allows a certain shift of focus that helps to break through the narrow patterns of thinking that lead to the destructive feeling of unfairness that is the source of so much discontent in ourselves and in the world."}, {"text": "  \fGUILT  As products of an imperfect world, all of us are imperfect. Every one of us has done some wrong. There are things we regret\u2014things we have done or things we should have done.

That must have been hard on you when you heard ...\u201d The Dalai Lama nodded sadly. \u201cHow did you deal with that feeling of regret? How did you eventually get rid of it?\u201d The Dalai Lama silently considered for quite a  \fwhile before replying, \u201cI didn\u2019t get rid of it."}, {"text": " It\u2019s still there.\u201d He stopped again, before adding, \u201cBut even though that feeling of regret is still there, it isn\u2019t associated with a feeling of heaviness or a quality of pulling me back. It would not be helpful to anyone if I let that feeling of regret weigh me down, be simply a source of discouragement and depression with no purpose, or interfere with going on with my life to the best of my ability."}, {"text": "\u201d At that moment, in a very visceral way, I was struck once again by the very real possibility of a human being\u2019s fully facing life\u2019s tragedies and responding emotionally, even with deep regret, but without indulging in excessive guilt or selfcontempt. The possibility of a human being\u2019s wholly accepting herself or himself, complete with limitations, foibles, and lapses of judgment."}, {"text": " The  \fpossibility of recognizing a bad situation for what it is and responding emotionally, but without overresponding.

In describing the ever-changing nature of life, the Dalai Lama explained, \u201cIt\u2019s extremely important to investigate the causes or origins of  \fsuffering, how it arises."}, {"text": " One must begin that process by appreciating the impermanent, transient nature of our existence. All things, events, and phenomena are dynamic, changing every moment; nothing remains static. Meditating on one\u2019s blood circulation could serve to reinforce this idea: the blood is constantly flowing, moving; it never stands still."}, {"text": " This momentarily changing nature of phenomena is like a built-in mechanism. And since it is the nature of all phenomena to change every moment, this indicates to us that all things lack the ability to endure, lack the ability to remain the same. And since all things are subject to change, nothing exists in a permanent condition, nothing is able to remain the same under its own independent power."}, {"text": " Thus, all things are under the power or influence of other factors. So, at any given  \fmoment, no matter how pleasant or pleasurable your experience may be, it will not last. This becomes the basis of a category of suffering known in Buddhism as the \u2018suffering of change.\u2019 \u201d  The concept of impermanence plays a central role in Buddhist thought, and the contemplation of impermanence is a key practice."}, {"text": " Contemplation of impermanence serves two main vital functions within the Buddhist path. On a conventional level, or in an everyday sense, the Buddhist practitioner contemplates his or her own impermanence\u2014the fact that life is tenuous and we never know when we\u2019ll die. When this  \freflection is combined with a belief in the rarity of human existence and the possibility of attaining a state of spiritual Liberation, of release from suffering and endless rounds of rebirth, then this contemplation serves to increase the practitioner\u2019s resolve to use her or his time to best advantage, by engaging in the spiritual practices that will bring about this Liberation."}, {"text": " On a deeper level, the contemplation of the more subtle aspects of impermanence, the impermanent nature of all phenomena, begins the practitioner\u2019s quest to understand the true nature of reality and, through this understanding, dispel the ignorance that is the ultimate source of our suffering. So, while the contemplation of impermanence has tremendous significance within a Buddhist context, the question arises: does the  \fcontemplation and understanding of impermanence have any practical application in the everyday lives of non-Buddhists as well? If we view the concept of \u201cimpermanence\u201d from the standpoint of \u201cchange,\u201d then the answer is a definite yes."}, {"text": " After all, whether one looks at life from a Buddhist perspective or a Western perspective, the fact remains that life is change. And to the degree that we refuse to accept this fact and resist the natural life changes, we will continue to perpetuate our own suffering. The acceptance of change can be an important factor in reducing a large measure of our self-created suffering."}, {"text": " So often, for instance, we cause our own suffering by refusing to relinquish the past. If we define our self-image in terms of what we used to look like or in terms of what we used to be able to do and can\u2019t do now,  \fit is a pretty safe bet that we won\u2019t grow happier as we grow older. Sometimes, the more we try to hold on, the more grotesque and distorted life becomes."}, {"text": " While the acceptance of the inevitability of change, as a general principle, can help us cope with many problems, taking a more active role by specifically learning about normal life changes can prevent an even greater amount of the day-today anxiety that is the cause of many of our troubles. Revealing the value of recognizing normal life changes, a new mother told me about a visit to the emergency room she had made at two o\u2018clock in the morning."}, {"text": " \u201cWhat seems to be the problem?\u201d the pediatrician asked her. \u201cMY BABY! SOMETHING\u2019S WRONG!\u201d  \fshe cried frantically, \u201cI think he\u2019s choking or something! His tongue keeps protruding ; he just keeps sticking it out ... over and over again ... like he\u2019s trying to get something out, but there\u2019s nothing in his mouth ."}, {"text": "..\u201d After a few questions and a brief examination, the doctor assured her, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about. As a baby grows, he develops an increasing awareness of his own body and what it can do. Your baby has just discovered his tongue.\u201d  Margaret, a thirty-one-year-old journalist, illustrates the critical importance of understanding and accepting change in the context of a personal relationship."}, {"text": " She came to me complaining of mild anxiety which she attributed to difficulty adjusting  \fto a recent divorce. \u201cI thought that it might be a good idea to have a few sessions just to talk to someone,\u201d she explained, \u201cto help me really put the past to rest and make the transition back to the single life."}, {"text": " To be honest, I\u2019m a little nervous about it ...\u201d I asked her to describe the circumstances of her divorce. \u201cI guess I\u2019d have to describe it as amiable. There were no big fights or anything like that. My ex and I both have good jobs, so there weren\u2019t any problems with a financial settlement."}, {"text": " We have one boy, but he seems to have adjusted to the divorce well, and my ex and I have a joint custody agreement that is working well ...\u201d \u201cI mean, can you tell me what led to the divorce?\u201d \u201cUmm ... I suppose we just fell out of love,\u201d  \fshe sighed. \u201cIt seemed that gradually the romance was gone; we just didn\u2019t have the same intimacy that we had when we were first married."}, {"text": " We both got busy with our jobs and our son and just seemed to drift apart. We tried some sessions of marital counseling, but they didn\u2019t do any good. We still got along, but it was like we were brother and sister. It didn\u2019t feel like love, like a real marriage. Anyway, we mutually agreed that it would be best to get a divorce; something just wasn\u2019t there anymore."}, {"text": "\u201d After spending two sessions delineating her problem, we decided on a course of short-term psychotherapy, focusing specifically on helping her reduce her anxiety and adjust to her recent life changes. Overall, she was an intelligent and emotionally well-adjusted person. She responded very well to a brief course of therapy and easily  \fmade the transition back to single life."}, {"text": " Despite obviously caring for each other, it was clear that Margaret and her husband had interpreted the change in their level of passion as a sign that the marriage should end. All too often we interpret a diminution of passion as a signal that there is a fatal problem in the relationship. And more often than not, the first whisper of change in our relationship may create a sense of panic, a feeling that something is drastically wrong."}, {"text": " Perhaps we did not pick the right partner after all. Our mate just doesn\u2019t seem like the person we fell in love with. Disagreements come up\u2014we may be in the mood for sex and our partner is tired, we may want to see a special movie but our partner has no interest in it or is always busy. We may discover differences that we never noticed before."}, {"text": " So, we conclude, it  \fmust be over; after all, there\u2019s no getting around the fact that we are growing apart. Things just aren\u2019t the same anymore; maybe we should get a divorce. So what do we do? Relationship experts churn out books by the dozen, cookbooks telling us exactly what to do when the passion and flame of romance grow dim."}, {"text": " They offer a myriad of suggestions designed to help rekindle the romance\u2014restructure your schedule to make romantic time a priority, plan romantic dinners or weekend getaways, compliment your mate, learn how to have a meaningful conversation. Sometimes these things help. Sometimes they don\u2019t. But before pronouncing the relationship dead, one of the most beneficial things we can do when we notice a change is to simply stand back,  \fassess the situation, and arm ourselves with as much knowledge as possible about the normal patterns of change in relationships."}, {"text": " As our lives play out, we develop from infancy to childhood, to adulthood, to old age. We accept these changes in individual development as a natural progression. But a relationship is also a dynamic living system, composed of two organisms interacting in a living environment. And as a living system, it is equally natural and right that the relationship go through stages."}, {"text": " In any relationship, there are different dimensions of closeness\u2014physical, emotional, and intellectual. Bodily contact, sharing emotions, thoughts, and exchanging ideas are all legitimate ways of connecting with those we love. It is normal for the balance to wax and wane: sometimes physical closeness decreases but  \femotional closeness can increase; at other times we don\u2019t feel like sharing words but just want to be held."}, {"text": " If we are sensitive to this issue, we can rejoice in the initial bloom of passion in a relationship, but if it cools, instead of feeling worry or anger, we can open ourselves to new forms of intimacy that can be equally\u2014or perhaps more\u2014satisfying. We can delight in our partner as a companion, enjoy a steadier love, a deeper bond."}, {"text": " In his book Intimate Bebavior, DesmondMorris describes the normal changes that occur in a human being\u2019s need for closeness. He suggests that each of us repeatedly goes through three stages: \u201cHold me tight,\u201d \u201cPut me down,\u201d and \u201cLeave me alone.\u201d The cycle first becomes apparentin the firstyears of life when children move from the \u201chold me tight\u201d phase  \fcharacteristic of infancy to the \u201cput me down\u201d stage when the child first begins to explore the world, crawl, walk, and achieve some independence and autonomy from the mother."}, {"text": " This is part of normal development and growth. These phases do not just move in one direction, however ; at various stages a child may experience some anxiety when the feeling of separateness becomes too great, and then the child will return to the mother for soothing and closeness. In adolescence, \u201cleave me alone\u201d becomes the predominant phase as the child struggles to form an individual identity."}, {"text": " Although this may be difficult or painful for the parents, most experts recognize it as a normal and necessary phase in the transition from childhood to adulthood. Even within this phase, there is still a mixture of phases. While the adolescent is  \fcrying \u201cLeave me alone!\u201d to his parents at home, the \u201chold me tight\u201d needs may be met by strong identification with the peer group."}, {"text": " In adult relationships as well, the same flux occurs. Levels of intimacy change, with periods of greater intimacy alternating with periods of greater distance. This is also part of the normal cycle of growth and development. To reach our full potential as human beings, we need to be able to balance our needs for closeness and union with times when we must turn inward, with a sense of autonomy, to grow and develop as individuals."}, {"text": " As we come to understand this, we will no longer react with horror or panic when we first notice ourselves \u201cgrowing apart\u201d from our partner, any more than we would panic while watching the tide go out at the seashore. Of  \fcourse, sometimes a growing emotional distance can signal serious problems in a relationship (an unspoken undercurrent of anger for instance), and even breakups can occur."}, {"text": " In those cases, measures such as therapy can be very helpful. But the main point to keep in mind is that a growing distance doesn\u2019t automatically spell disaster. It can also be part of a cycle that returns to redefine the relationship in a new form that can recapture or even surpass the intimacy that existed in the past."}, {"text": " So, the act of acceptance, of acknowledging that change is a natural part of our interactions with others, can play a vital role in our relationships. We may discover that it is at the very time when we may feel most disappointed, as if something has gone out of the relationship, that a profound transformation can occur."}, {"text": " These  \ftransitional periods can become pivotal points when true love can begin to mature and flower. Our relationship may no longer be based on intense passion, the view of the other as the embodiment of perfection, or the feeling that we are merged with the other. But in exchange for that, we are now in a position to truly begin to know the other\u2014to see the other as he or she is, a separate individual, with faults and weaknesses perhaps, but a human being like ourselves."}, {"text": " It is only at this point that we can make a genuine commitment, a commitment to the growth of another human being\u2014an act of true love. Perhaps Margaret\u2019s marriage could have been salvaged by accepting the natural change in the relationship and forming a new relationship based on factors other than passion and romance."}, {"text": "  \fFortunately, however, the story didn\u2019t end there. Two years after my last session with Margaret, I ran into her at a shopping mall (the situation of running into an ex-patient in a social setting is one that invariably makes me, like most therapists, feel a bit awkward). \u201cHow have you been?\u201d I asked."}, {"text": " \u201cThings couldn\u2019t be better!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cLast month, my ex-husband and I remarried.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d \u201cYeah, and it\u2019s going great. We continued to see each other, of course, because of the joint custody. Anyway, it was difficult at first ... but after the divorce, somehow the pressure was off."}, {"text": " We didn\u2019t have any expectations .anymore. And we found out that we really did like each other and love each other. Things still aren\u2019t the same as when we were first married, but it doesn\u2019t  \fseem to matter; we\u2019re really happy together. It just feels right.\u201d  \fChapter 10  SHIFTING PERSPECTIVE  Once there was a disciple of a Greek philosopher who was commanded by his Master for three years to give money to  \feveryone who insulted him."}, {"text": " When this period of trial was over the Master said to him, \u201cNow you can go to Athens and learn Wisdom.\u201d When the disciple was entering Athens, he met a certain wise man who sat at the gate insulting everybody who came and went. He also insulted the disciple, who burst out laughing. \u201cWhy do you laugh when I insult you?\u201d said the wise man."}, {"text": " \u201cBecause,\u201d said the disciple, \u201cfor three years I have been paying for this kind of thing and now you give it to me for nothing.\u201d \u201cEnter the city,\u201d said the wise man, \u201cit is all yours ...\u201d The fourth-century Desert Fathers, an assortment of eccentric characters who retired to the deserts around Scete for a life of sacrifice and prayer,  \ftaught this story to illustrate the value of suffering and hardship."}, {"text": " It wasn\u2019t hardship alone, however, that opened the \u201ccity of wisdom\u201d to the disciple. The prime factor that allowed him to deal so effectively with a difficult situation was his capacity to shift perspective, to view his situation from a different vantage point. The ability to shift perspective can be one of the most powerful and effective tools we have to help us cope with life\u2019s daily problems."}, {"text": " The Dalai Lama explained: \u201cThe ability to look at events from different perspectives can be very helpful. Then, practicing this, one can use certain experiences, certain tragedies to develop a calmness of mind. One must realize that every phenomena, every event, has different aspects. Everything is of a relative nature."}, {"text": " For example, in my own case, I lost my  \fcountry. From that viewpoint, it is very tragic\u2014 and there are even worse things. There\u2019s a lot of destruction happening in our country. That\u2019s a very negative thing. But if I look at the same event from another angle, I realize that as a refugee, I have another perspective."}, {"text": " As a refugee there is no need for formalities, ceremony, protocol. If everything were status quo, if things were okay, then on a lot of occasions you merely go through the motions; you pretend. But when you are passing through desperate situations, there\u2019s no time to pretend. So from that angle, this tragic experience has been very useful to me."}, {"text": " Also, being a refugee creates a lot of new opportunities for meeting with many people. People from different religious traditions, from different walks of life, those who I may not have met had I remained in my country. So in that  \fsense it\u2019s been very, very useful. \u201cIt seems that often when problems arise, our outlook becomes narrow."}, {"text": " All of our attention may be focused on worrying about the problem, and we may have a sense that we\u2019re the only one that is going through such difficulties. This can lead to a kind of self-absorption that can make the problem seem very intense. When this happens, I think that seeing things from a wider perspective can definitely help\u2014realizing, for instance, that there are many other people who have gone through similar experiences, and even worse experiences."}, {"text": " This practice of shifting perspective can even be helpful in certain illnesses or when in pain. At the time the pain arises it is of course often very difficult, at that moment, to do formal meditation practices to calm the mind. But if you can make comparisons,  \fview your situation from a different perspective, somehow something happens."}, {"text": " If you only look at that one event, then it appears bigger and bigger. If you focus too closely, too intensely, on a problem when it occurs, it appears uncontrollable. But if you compare that event with some other greater event, look at the same problem from a distance, then it appears smaller and less overwhelming."}, {"text": "\u201d  Shortly before one session with the Dalai Lama, I happened to run into an administrator of a facility where I used to work. During my tenure at his facility we had a number of run-ins because I believed that he was compromising patient care  \fin favor of financial considerations. I hadn\u2019t seen him in quite a while, but as soon as I spotted him, all of our arguments came flooding back and I could feel the anger and hatred welling up inside me."}, {"text": " By the time I was ushered into the Dalai Lama\u2019s hotel suite for our session later that day, I was considerably calmer, but still feeling a bit unsettled. \u201cLet\u2019s say that someone makes you angry,\u201d I began. \u201cYour natural response to being hurt, your immediate response, is to get angry. But in a lot of cases, it\u2019s not just a matter of getting angry at the time you\u2019re being hurt."}, {"text": " You might think about the event later, even much later, and every time you think about it you become angry all over again. How would you suggest dealing with that kind of situation?\u201d The Dalai Lama nodded thoughtfully, and  \flooked at me. I wondered if he sensed that I wasn\u2019t bringing up the topic for purely academic reasons."}, {"text": " \u201cIf you look from a different angle,\u201d he said, \u201cthen surely the person who caused this anger in you will have a lot of other positive aspects, positive qualities. If you look carefully, you will also find that the act which has made you angry has also given you certain opportunities, something which otherwise would not have been possible, even from your point of view."}, {"text": " So with effort you\u2019ll be able to see many different angles to a single event. This will help.\u201d \u201cBut what about if you look for the positive angles of a person or event and can\u2019t find any?\u201d \u201cHere, I think, we would be dealing with a situation where you might need to make some effort. Spend some time seriously searching for a  \fdifferent perspective on the situation."}, {"text": " Not just in a superficial way. But in a very pointed and direct way. You need to use all your powers of reasoning and look at the situation as objectively as possible. For instance, you might reflect on the fact that when you are really angry at someone you tend to perceive them as having 100 percent negative qualities."}, {"text": " Just as when you are strongly attracted to someone the tendency is to see them as having 100 percent positive qualities. But this perception does not correspond with reality. If your friend, who you view as so wonderful, were to purposely harm you in some way, suddenly you would become acutely aware that they aren\u2019t composed of 100 percent good qualities."}, {"text": " Similarly, if your enemy, the one you hate, were to sincerely beg your forgiveness and continue to show you kindness, it\u2019s unlikely that you would  \fcontinue to perceive them as 100 percent bad. So, even though when you are angry at someone you might feel that the person has no positive qualities, the reality is that nobody is 100 percent bad."}, {"text": " They must have some good qualities if you search hard enough. So, the tendency to see someone as completely negative is due to your own perception based on your own mental projection, rather than the true nature of that individual. \u201cIn the same way, a situation that you initially perceive as 100 percent negative may have some positive aspects to it."}, {"text": " But I think that even if you have discovered a positive angle to a bad situation, that alone is often not enough. You still need to reinforce that idea. So you may need to remind yourself of that positive angle many times, until gradually your feeling changes. Generally  \fspeaking, once you\u2019re already in a difficult situation, it isn\u2019t possible to change your attitude simply by adopting a particular thought once or twice."}, {"text": " Rather it\u2019s through a process of learning, training, and getting used to new viewpoints that enables you to deal with the difficulty.\u201d The Dalai Lama reflected for a moment, and, adhering to his usual pragmatic stance, he added, \u201cIf, however, in spite of your efforts, you do not find any such positive angles or perspectives to a person\u2019s act, then for the time being the best course of action may be to simply try to forget about it."}, {"text": "\u201d  \fInspired by the Dalai Lama\u2019s words, later that evening I tried to discover some \u201cpositive angles\u201d to the administrator, ways in which he was not \u201c100 percent bad.\u201d It wasn\u2019t hard. I knew him to be a loving father, for instance, trying to raise his children the best he could. And I had to admit that my run-ins with him had ultimately benefited me\u2014they had been instrumental in my decision to quit working at that facility, which ultimately led to more satisfying work."}, {"text": " While these reflections didn\u2019t immediately result in an overwhelming liking for this man, they unquestionably took the bite out of my feelings of hatred with surprisingly little effort. Soon, the Dalai Lama would offer an even more profound lesson: how to completely transform one\u2019s attitude toward one\u2019s enemies and learn to cherish them."}, {"text": "  \fA NEW PERSPECTIVE ON THE ENEMY  The Dalai Lama\u2019s primary method of transforming our attitude about our enemies involves a systematic and rational analysis of our customary response to those who harm us. He explained: \u201cLet\u2019s begin by examining our characteristic attitude toward our rivals. Generally speaking, of course, we do not wish good things for our enemies."}, {"text": " But even if your enemy is made unhappy through your actions, what is there for you to be so joyful about? If you think about it carefully, how can there be anything more  \fwretched than that? Carrying around the burden of such feelings of hostility and ill will. And do you really want to be that mean? \u201cIf we take revenge upon one\u2019s enemy, then it creates a kind of vicious cycle."}, {"text": " If you retaliate, the other person is not going to accept that\u2014he or she is going to retaliate against you, and then you will do the same, so it will go on. And especially when this happens at the community level, it can go on from generation to generation. The result is that both sides suffer. Then, the whole purpose of life becomes spoiled."}, {"text": " You can see this in the refugee camps, where hatred is cultivated towards another group. This happens from childhood on. It is very sad. So, anger or hatred is like a fisherman\u2019s hook. It\u2019s very important for us to ensure that we are not caught by this hook.  \f\u201cNow, some people consider that strong hatred is good for national interest."}, {"text": " I think this is very negative. It is very short-sighted. Counteracting this way of thinking is the basis of the spirit of nonviolence and understanding.\u201d Having challenged our characteristic attitude toward one\u2019s enemy, the Dalai Lama went on to offer an alternative way of viewing one\u2019s enemy, a new perspective that could have a revolutionary impact on one\u2019s life."}, {"text": " He explained: \u201cIn Buddhism in general, a lot of attention is paid to our attitudes towards our rivals or enemies. This is because hatred can be the greatest stumbling block to the development of compassion and happiness. If you can learn to develop patience and tolerance towards your enemies, then everything else becomes much easier\u2014your compassion towards all others  \fbegins to flow naturally."}, {"text": " \u201cSo, for a spiritual practitioner, one\u2019s enemies play a crucial role. As I see it, compassion is the essence of a spiritual life. And in order for you to become fully successful in practicing love and compassion, the practice of patience and tolerance is indispensable. There is no fortitude similar to patience, just as there is no affliction worse than hatred."}, {"text": " Therefore, one must exert one\u2019s best efforts not to harbor hatred towards the enemy, but rather use the encounter as an opportunity to enhance one\u2019s practice of patience and tolerance. \u201cIn fact, the enemy is the necessary condition for practicing patience. Without an enemy\u2019s action, there is no possibility for patience or tolerance to arise."}, {"text": " Our friends do not ordinarily test us and provide the opportunity to  \fcultivate patience; only our enemies do this. So, from this standpoint we can consider our enemy as a great teacher, and revere them for giving us this precious opportunity to practice patience. \u201cNow there are many, many people in the world, but relatively few with whom we interact, and even fewer who cause us problems."}, {"text": " So when you come across such a chance for practicing patience and tolerance, you should treat it with gratitude. It is rare. Just as having unexpectedly found a treasure in your own house, you should be happy and grateful towards your enemy for providing that precious opportunity. Because if you are ever to be successful in your practice of patience and tolerance, which are critical factors in counteracting negative emotions, it is due to the combination of your own efforts and also the  \fopportunity provided by your enemy."}, {"text": " \u201cOf course, one might still feel, \u2018Why should I venerate my enemy, or acknowledge his or her contribution, because the enemy had no intention to give me this precious opportunity for practicing patience, no intention of helping me? And not only do they have no wish or intention to help me, but they have a deliberate malicious intention to harm me! Therefore, it\u2019s appropriate to hate them\u2014they are definitely not worthy of respect."}, {"text": "\u2019 Actually, it is in fact the presence of this hateful state of mind in the enemy, the intention to hurt us, that makes the enemy\u2019s action unique. Otherwise, if it is just the actual act of hurting us, then we would hate doctors and consider them as enemies because sometimes they adopt methods that can be painful, such as surgery."}, {"text": " But still, we do not consider these acts as harmful or  \fthe acts of an enemy because the intention on the part of the doctor was to help us. So, therefore, it is exactly this willful intention to harm us that makes the enemy unique and gives us this precious opportunity to practice patience.\u201d  The Dalai Lama\u2019s suggestion to venerate one\u2019s enemies because of the opportunities for growth they provide might be a bit hard to swallow at first."}, {"text": " But the situation is analogous to a person seeking to tone and strengthen one\u2019s body through weight training. Of course, the activity of lifting is uncomfortable at first\u2014the weights are heavy. One strains, sweats, struggles. Yet it is the very act of struggling against the resistance that  \fultimately results in our strength."}, {"text": " One appreciates good weight equipment not for any immediate pleasure it provides, but for the ultimate benefit one receives. Perhaps even the Dalai Lama\u2019s claims about the \u201crarity\u201d and \u201cpreciousness\u201d of The Enemy are more than just fanciful ratio nalizations. As I listen to my patients describe their difficulties with others, this becomes quite clear\u2014when it comes down to it, most people don\u2019t have legions of enemies and antagonists they\u2019re struggling with, at least on a personal level."}, {"text": " Usually the conflict is just confined to a few people. A boss perhaps, or a coworker, an ex-spouse, a sibling. From that standpoint, The Enemy is truly \u201crare\u201d\u2014our supply is limited. And it\u2019s the struggle, the process of resolving the conflict with The Enemy \u2014through learning, examining, finding alternative  \fways of dealing with them\u2014that ultimately results in true growth, insight, and a successful psychotherapeutic outcome."}, {"text": " Imagine what it would be like if we went through life never encountering an enemy or any other obstacles for that matter, if from the cradle to the grave everyone we met pampered us, held us, hand-fed us (soft bland food, easy to digest), amused us with funny faces and the occasional \u201cgoo-goo\u201d noise."}, {"text": " If from infancy we were carried around in a basket (later on, perhaps on a litter), never encountering any challenge, never tested\u2014 in short, if everyone continued to treat us like a baby. That might sound good at first. For the first few months of life it might be appropriate. But if it persisted it could only result in one becoming a sort of gelatinous mass, a monstrosity really\u2014 with the mental and emotional development of  \fveal."}, {"text": " It\u2019s the very struggle of life that makes us who we are. And it is our enemies that test us, provide us with the resistance necessary for growth.  \fIS THIS ATTITUDE PRACTICAL?  The practice of approaching our problems rationally and learning to view our troubles or our enemies from alternative perspectives certainly seemed like a worthwhile pursuit, but I wondered to what degree this could really bring about a fundamental transformation of attitude."}, {"text": " I remembered once reading in an interview that one of the Dalai Lama\u2019s daily spiritual practices was the recitation of a prayer, The Eight Verses on the Training of the Mind, written in the eleventh century by the Tibetan saint, Langri Thangpa. It reads, in part: Whenever I associate with someone,  \fmay I think myself the lowest among all and hold the other supreme in the depth of my heart! ."}, {"text": ".. When Isee beings of wicked nature, pressed by violent sin and affliction, may I hold these rare ones dear as if I had found a precious treasure! ... When others, out of envy, treat me badly with abuse, slander and the like, may I suffer the defeat and offer the victory to others! ...

Two points vividly emerged. First, I was struck by his extraordinary readiness to take a fresh look at his own beliefs and practices \u2014in this case, demonstrating a willingness to reevaluate a cherished prayer that had no doubt fused with his very being through years of repetition."}, {"text": " The second point was less inspiring. I was overcome with a sense of my own arrogance! It occurred to me that I had suggested to him that the prayer might not be appropriate because it wasn\u2019t in keeping with the  \fharsh realities of today\u2019s world. But it wasn\u2019t until later that I reflected on who I had been speaking to\u2014a man who had lost an entire country as a result of one of the most brutal invasions in history."}, {"text": " A man who has lived in exile for almost four decades while an entire nation placed their hopes and dreams of freedom on him.

Often they involved the attempt to destroy the spirit of the Tibetan people."}, {"text": " A Tibetan refugee once told me about the Chinese \u201cschool\u201d he was required to attend as a youngster growing up in Tibet. The mornings were devoted to indoctrination and study of Chairman Mao\u2019s \u201clittle red book.\u201d The afternoons were devoted to reporting on various homework assignments.

On my return home I took a nonstop flight back to Phoenix."}, {"text": " As usual, I had booked an aisle seat. Despite having just attended spiritual teachings, I was in a rather cranky mood as I boarded the packed plane. Then I discovered I had been mistakenly assigned a center seat\u2014sandwiched between a  \fman of generous proportions who had the annoying habit of draping his thick forearm over my side of the armrest and a middle-aged woman whom I took an immediate dislike to because, I decided, she had usurped my aisle seat."}, {"text": " There was something about this woman that really bothered me\u2014her voice a bit too shrill, her manner a bit too imperial, I\u2019m not sure.

After about twenty minutes, I gave it up\u2014she still bugged me! I resigned  \fmyself to remaining irritable for the rest of the flight."}, {"text": " Sulking, I glared at one of her hands that was furtively encroaching on my armrest. I hated everything about this woman. I was staring absently at her thumbnail when it occurred to me: Do I hate that thumbnail? Not really. It was just an ordinary thumbnail. Unremarkable. Next, I glanced at her eye and asked myself: Do I really hate that eye? Yes, I did."}, {"text": " (Of course, for no good reason\u2014which is the purest form of hate). I focused in closer. Do I hate that pupil? No. Do I hate that cornea, that iris, or that sclera? No. So, do I really hate that eye? I had to admit that I didn\u2019t. I felt that I was on to something. I moved on to a knuckle, a finger, a jaw, an elbow."}, {"text": " With some surprise I realized that there were parts of this woman that I didn\u2019t hate. Focusing on details, on particulars, instead of  \fovergeneralizations, allowed a subtle internal change, a softening. This shift of perspective tore an opening in my prejudice, just wide enough to look at her as simply another human being."}, {"text": " As I was feeling this, she suddenly turned to me and started a conversation. I don\u2019t remember what we talked about\u2014it was small talk mostly\u2014but by the end of the flight my anger and annoyance had been diffused.

The ultimate benefit of a supple mind is that it allows us to embrace all of life\u2014to be fully alive and human. Following a long day of public talks in Tucson one afternoon, the Dalai Lama walked back to his hotel suite."}, {"text": " As he slowly walked back to his room, a bank of magenta rain clouds spanned the sky, absorbing the late afternoon light and sending the Catalina Mountains into deep relief, the entire landscape a vast palette of purple hues. The effect was spectacular. The warm air, laden with the fragrance of desert  \fplants, of sage, a dampness, a restless breeze, holding the promise of an unbridled Sonoran storm."}, {"text": " The Dalai Lama stopped. For several moments he quietly surveyed the horizon, taking in the entire panorama, finally commenting on the beauty of the setting. He walked on, but after a few steps he paused again, bending down to examine a tiny lavender bud on a small plant. He touched it gently, noting its delicate form, and wondered aloud about the name of the plant."}, {"text": " I was struck by the facility with which his mind functioned. His awareness seemed to move so easily from taking in the complete landscape to focusing on a single bud, a simultaneous appreciation of the totality of the environment as well as the smallest detail. A capacity to encompass all facets and the full spectrum of life."}, {"text": " Every one of us can develop this same  \fsuppleness of mind. It comes about, at least in part, directly through our efforts to stretch our perspective and deliberately try on new viewpoints. The end result is a simultaneous awareness of the big picture as well as our individual circumstances. This dual outlook, a concurrent view of the \u201cBig World\u201d and our own \u201cLittle World,\u201d can act as a kind of triage, helping us separate what is important in life from what isn\u2019t."}, {"text": "  In my own case, it took a bit of gentle prodding by the Dalai Lama, during the course of our  \fconversations, before I began to break out of my own limited perspective. By nature and training, I\u2019ve always tended to address problems from the standpoint of individual dynamics\u2014psychological processes occurring purely within the domain of the mind."}, {"text": " Sociological or political perspectives have never held much interest for me. In one discussion with the Dalai Lama I started questioning him about the importance of achieving a wider perspective. Having had several cups of coffee earlier, my conversation started to become quite animated and I began to speak about the ability to shift perspective as an internal process, a solitary pursuit, based solely on an individual\u2019s conscious decision to adopt a different view."}, {"text": " In the midst of my spirited discourse, the Dalai Lama finally interrupted to remind me,  \f\u201cWhen you speak of adopting a wider perspective this includes working cooperatively with other people. When you have crises which are global by nature for instance, such as the environment or problems of modern economic structure, this calls for a coordinated and concerted effort among many people, with a sense of responsibility and commitment."}, {"text": " This is more encompassing than an individual or personal issue.\u201d I was annoyed that he was dragging in the subject of the world while I was trying to concentrate on the subject of the individual (and this attitude, I\u2019m embarrassed to admit, on the very topic of widening one\u2019s viewpoint!). \u201cBut this week,\u201d I insisted, \u201cin our conversations and in your public talks, you\u2019ve spoken a lot about the importance of effecting  \fpersonal change from within, through internal transformation."}, {"text": " For instance, you\u2019ve spoken about the importance of developing compassion, a warm heart, of overcoming anger and hatred, cultivating patience and tolerance ...\u201d \u201cYes. Of course, change must come from within the individual. But when you are seeking solutions to global problems, you need to be able to approach these problems from the standpoint of the individual as well as from the level of society at large."}, {"text": " So, when you\u2019re talking about being flexible, about having a wider perspective and so on, this requires the ability to address problems from various levels: the individual level, the community level, and the global level. \u201cNow, for instance, at the talk at the university the other evening, I spoke about the need to reduce anger and hatred through the  \fcultivation of patience and tolerance."}, {"text": " Minimizing hatred is like internal disarmament. But, as I also mentioned in that talk, that internal disarmament must go with external disarmament. That I think is very, very important. Fortunately, after the Soviet empire collapsed, at least for the time being, there is no more threat of nuclear holocaust."}, {"text": " So, I think this is a very good time, a very good start\u2014 we should not miss this opportunity! Now I think we must strengthen the genuine force of peace. Real peace\u2014not just mere absence of violence or absence of war. Mere absence of war can be produced by weapons\u2014like the nuclear deterrent. But a mere absence of war is not genuine, lasting world peace."}, {"text": " Peace must develop on mutual trust. And since weapons are the greatest obstacle for development of mutual trust, I think the time has now come to figure out  \fhow to get rid of these weapons. That is very important. Of course, we cannot achieve this overnight. I think the realistic way is step by step."}, {"text": " But anyway, I think we must make our ultimate goal very clear: The whole world should be demilitarized. So, on one level we should be working toward developing inner peace, but at the same time it\u2019s very important to work towards external disarmament and peace as well, making a small contribution in whatever way we can."}, {"text": " That\u2019s our responsibility.\u201d  \fTHE IMPORTANCE OF FLEXIBLE THINKING  There is a reciprocal relationship between a supple mind and the ability to shift perspective: A supple, flexible mind helps us address our problems from a variety of perspectives, and, conversely, deliberately trying to objectively examine our problems from a variety of perspectives can be seen as a kind of flexibility training for the mind."}, {"text": " In today\u2019s world, the attempt to develop a flexible mode of thinking isn\u2019t simply a self-indulgent exercise for idle iritellectuals-it can be a matter of survival. Even on an evolutionary scale, the species that have  \fbeen most flexible, most adaptable to environmental changes, have survived and thrived."}, {"text": " Life today is characterized by sudden, unexpected, and sometimes violent change. A supple mind can help us reconcile the external changes going on all around us. It can also help us integrate all of our internal conflicts, inconsistencies, and ambivalence. Without cultivating a pliant mind, our outlook becomes brittle and our relationship to the world becomes characterized by fear."}, {"text": " But by adopting a flexible, malleable approach to life, we can maintain our composure even in the most restless and turbulent conditions. It is through our efforts to achieve a flexible mind that we can nurture the resiliency of the human spirit.  \fAs I got to know the Dalai Lama, I became amazed at the extent of his flexibility, his capacity to entertain a variety of viewpoints."}, {"text": " One would expect that his unique role as probably the world\u2019s most recognized Buddhist might put him in the position of being a sort of Defender of The Faith.

In fact, it\u2019s just the opposite. Sometimes I\u2019m so flexible that I\u2019m accused of having no consistent policy.\u201d He broke into a robust laugh. \u201cSomeone will come to me and present a certain idea, and I\u2019ll see the reason in what they\u2019re saying and agree,  \ftelling them, Oh, that\u2019s great!\u2018 ."}, {"text": ".. But then the next person comes along with the opposite viewpoint, and I\u2019ll see the reason in what they are saying as well and agree with them also. Sometimes I\u2019m criticized for this and have to be reminded, \u2019We\u2019re committed to this course of action, so for the time being let\u2019s just keep to this side."}, {"text": "\u2018 \u201d From this statement alone one might get the impression that the Dalai Lama is indecisive, with no guiding principles. In fact, that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. The Dalai Lama clearly has a set of basic beliefs that act as a substrate for all his actions: A belief in the underlying goodness of all human beings."}, {"text": " A belief in the value of compassion. A policy of kindness. A sense of his commonality with all living creatures. In speaking of the importance of being  \fflexible, malleable, and adaptable, I don\u2019t mean to suggest that we become like chameleons\u2014 soaking up any new belief system that we happen to be around at the time, changing our identity, passively absorbing every idea that we\u2019re exposed to."}, {"text": " Higher stages of growth and development depend on an underlying set of values that can guide us. A value system that can provide continuity and coherence to our lives, by which we can measure our experiences. A value system that can help us decide which goals are truly worthwhile and which pursuits are meaningless."}, {"text": " The question is, how can we consistently and steadfastly maintain this set of underlying values and yet remain flexible? The Dalai Lama has seemed to achieve this by first reducing his belief system to a few fundamental facts: 1) I am a  \fhuman being. 2) I want to be happy and I don\u2019t want to suffer."}, {"text": " 3) Other human beings, like myself, also want to be happy and don\u2019t want to suffer. Emphasizing the common ground he shares with others, rather than the differences, results in a feeling of connection with all human beings and leads to his basic belief in the value of compassion and altruism. Using the same approach, it can be tremendously rewarding simply to take some time to reflect on our own value system and reduce it to its fundamental principles."}, {"text": " It is the ability to reduce our value system to its most basic elements, and live from that vantage point, that allows us the greatest freedom and flexibility to deal with the vast array of problems that confront us on a daily basis.  \fFINDING BALANCE  Developing a flexible approach to living is not only instrumental in helping us cope with everyday problems\u2014it also becomes the cornerstone for a key element of a happy life: balance."}, {"text": " Settling comfortably into his chair one morning, the Dalai Lama explained the value of leading a balanced life. \u201cA balanced and skillful approach to life, taking care to avoid extremes, becomes a very important factor in conducting one\u2019s everyday existence. It is important in all aspects of life."}, {"text": " For instance, in planting a sapling of a plant or a tree, at its very early stage you have to be very skillful  \fand gentle. Too much moisture will destroy it, too much sunlight will destroy it. Too little will also destroy it. So what you need is a very balanced environment where the sapling can have a healthy growth."}, {"text": " Or, for a person\u2019s physical health, too much or too little of any one thing can have destructive effects. For example, too much protein I think is bad, and too little is bad. \u201cThis gentle and skillful approach, taking care to avoid extremes, applies to healthy mental and emotional growth as well."}, {"text": " For instance, if we find ourselves becoming arrogant, being puffed up by self-importance based on one\u2019s supposed or actual achievements or qualities, then the antidote is to think more about one\u2019s own problems and suffering, contemplating the unsatisfactory aspects of existence. This will assist you in bringing down the level of your heightened state  \fof mind, bringing you more down to earth."}, {"text": " And on the contrary, if you find that reflecting on the unsatisfactory nature of existence, suffering and pain and so forth, makes you feel quite overwhelmed by the whole thing, then, again, there\u2019s a danger of going to the other extreme. In that case you might become totally discouraged, helpless, and depressed, thinking that\u2018Oh, I can\u2019t do anything, I\u2019m worthless."}, {"text": "\u2019 So under such circumstances, it\u2019s important to be able to uplift your mind by reflecting on your achievements, the progress that you have made so far, and your other positive qualities so that you can uplift your mind and get out of that discouraged or demoralized state of mind. So what is required here is a kind of very balanced and skillful approach."}, {"text": " \u201cNot only is this approach helpful for one\u2019s  \fphysical and emotional health, but it applies to one\u2019s spiritual growth as well. Now, for instance, the Buddhist tradition includes many different techniques and practices. But it is very important to be very skillful in one\u2019s application of the various techniques, and not to be too extreme."}, {"text": " One needs a balanced and skillful approach here too. When undertaking Buddhist practice it is important to have a coordinated approach, combining studying and learning with the practices of contemplation and meditation. This is important so that there won\u2019t be any imbalances between academic or intellectual learning and practical implementation."}, {"text": " Otherwise, there is a danger that too much intellectualization will kill the more contemplative practices. But then, too much emphasis on practical implementation without study will kill the understanding. So there  \fhas got to be a balance....\u201d After a moment\u2019s reflection, he added, \u201cSo, in other words, the practice of Dbarma, real spiritual practice, is in some sense like a voltage stabilizer."}, {"text": " The function of the stabilizer is to prevent irregular power surges and instead give you a stable and constant source of power.\u201d \u201cYou stress the importance of avoiding extremes,\u201d I inserted, \u201cbut isn\u2019t going to extremes what provides the excitement and zest in life? By avoiding all extremes in life, always choosing the \u2018middle way,\u2019 doesn\u2019t that just lead to a bland, colorless existence?\u201d Shakinghis head no, he answered, \u201cI think you need to understand the source or basis of extreme behavior."}, {"text": " Take for example the pursuit of material goods\u2014shelter, furniture, clothing, and so on. On one hand, poverty can be seen as  \fa sort of extreme and we have every right to strive to overcome this and assure our physical comfort. On the other hand, too much luxury, pursuing excessive wealth is another extreme."}, {"text": " Our ultimate aim in seeking more wealth is a sense of satisfaction, of happiness. But the very basis of seeking more is a feeling of not having enough, a feeling of discontentment. That feeling of discontentment, of wanting more and more and more, doesn\u2019t arise from the inherent desirability of the objects we are seeking but rather from our own mental state."}, {"text": " \u201cSo I think that our tendency to go to extremes is often fueled by an underlying feeling of discontentment. And of course there may be other factors which lead to extremes. But I think it is important to recognize that while going to extremes may seem appealing or \u2018exciting\u2019 on the  \fsurface, it can in fact be harmful."}, {"text": " There are many examples of the dangers of going to extremes, of extreme behavior. I think that by examining these situations you\u2019il be able to see that the consequence of going to extremes is that you, yourself, will eventually suffer. For example, on a planetary scale if we engage in excessive fishing, without proper regard for long-term consequences, without a sense of responsibility, then it results in depletion of the fish population."}, {"text": ".. Or sexual behavior. Of course there is the biological sexual drive for reproduction and so on, and the satisfaction one gets from sexual activity. But if sexual behavior becomes extreme, without proper responsibility, it leads to so many problems, abuses ... like sexual abuse and incest.\u201d \u201cYou mentioned that in addition to a feeling of  \fdiscontentment, there may be other factors that lead to extremes."}, {"text": "...\u201d \u201cYes, certainly.\u201d He nodded. \u201cCan you give an example?\u201d \u201cI think narrow-mindedness could be another factor that leads to extremes.\u201d \u201cNarrow-mindedness in the sense of...?\u201d \u201cThe example of excessive fishing leading to depletion of the fish population would be an instance of narrow thinking, in the sense that one is looking only at the short term, and ignoring the wider picture."}, {"text": " Here, one could use education and knowledge to widen one\u2019s perspective and become less narrow in one\u2019s viewpoint.\u201d The Dalai Lama picked up his rosary from a side table, rubbing it between his hands as he silently mulled over the issue under discussion. Glancing at his rosary, he suddenly continued, \u201cI  \fthink in many ways narrow-minded attitudes lead to extreme thinking."}, {"text": " And this creates problems. For instance, Tibet was a Buddhist nation for many centuries. Naturally that resulted in Tibetans feeling that Buddhism was the best religion, and a tendency to feel that it would be a good thing if all of humanity became Buddhist. The idea that everyone should be Buddhist is quite extreme."}, {"text": " And that kind of extreme thinking just causes problems. But now that we\u2019ve left Tibet, we\u2019ve had a chance to come into contact with other religious traditions and learn about them. This has resulted in coming closer to reality \u2014real\u2014izing that among humanity there are so many different mental dispositions."}, {"text": " Even if we tried to make the whole world Buddhist it would be impractical. Through closer contact with other traditions you realize the positive things about  \fthem. Now, when confronted with another religion, initially a positive feeling, a comfortable feeling, will arise. We\u2019ll feel if that person finds a different tradition more suitable, more effective, then that\u2019s good! Then it\u2019s like going to a restaurant-we can all sit down at one table and order different dishes according to one\u2019s own taste."}, {"text": " We might eat different dishes, but nobody argues about it! \u201cSo, I think that by deliberately broadening our outlook we can often overcome the kind of extreme thinking that leads to such negative consequences.\u201d With this thought, the Dalai Lama slipped his rosary around his wrist, patted my hand amiably, and rose to end the discussion."}, {"text": "  \fChapter 11  FINDING MEANING IN PAIN AND SUFFERING  Victor Frankl, a Jewish psychiatrist imprisoned by the Nazis in World War II, once said, \u201cMan is ready and willing to shoulder any suffering as  \fsoon and as long as he can see a meaning in it.\u201d Frankl used his brutal and inhumane experience in the concentration camps to gain insight into how people survived the atrocities."}, {"text": " Closely observing who survived and who didn\u2018t, he determined that survival wasn\u2019t based on youth or physical strength but rather on the strength derived from purpose, and the discovery of meaning in one\u2019s life and experience. Finding meaning in suffering is a powerful method of helping us cope even during the most trying times in our lives."}, {"text": " But finding meaning in our suffering is not an easy task. Suffering often seems to occur at random, senselessly and indiscriminately, with no meaning at all, let alone a purposeful or positive meaning. And while we are in the midst of our pain and suffering, all our energy is focused on getting away from it."}, {"text": " During  \fperiods of acute crisis and tragedy it seems impossible to reflect on any possible meaning behind our suffering. At those times, there is often little we can do but endure. And it\u2019s natural to view our suffering as senseless and unfair, and wonder, \u201cWhy me?\u201d Fortunately, however, during times of comparative ease, periods before or after acute experiences of suffering, we can reflect on suffering, seeking to develop an understanding of its meaning."}, {"text": " And the time and effort we spend searching for meaning in suffering will pay great rewards when bad things begin to strike. But in order to reap those rewards, we must begin our search for meaning when things are going well. A tree with strong roots can withstand the most violent storm, but the tree can\u2019t grow roots just as the storm appears on the horizon."}, {"text": "  \fSo where do we begin in our search for meaning in suffering? For many people, the search begins with their religious tradition. Although different religions may have different ways of understanding the meaning and purpose of human suffering, every world religion offers strategies for responding to suffering based on its underlying beliefs."}, {"text": " In the Buddhist and Hindu models, for example, suffering is a result of our own negative past actions and is seen as a catalyst for seeking spiritual liberation. In the Judeo-Christian tradition, the universe was created by a good and just God, and even though His master plan may be mysterious and indecipherable at times, our faith and trust in His plan allow us to tolerate our suffering more easily, trusting, as the Talmud says, that \u201cEverything God does, He does for the best."}, {"text": "\u201d Life may still  \fbe painful, but like the pain a woman experiences in childbirth, we trust that the pain will be outweighed by the ultimate good it produces. The challenge in these traditions lies in the fact that, unlike in childbirth, the ultimate good is often not revealed to us. Still, those with a strong faith in God are sustained by a belief in God\u2019s ultimate purpose for our suffering, as a Hasidic sage advises, \u201cWhen a man suffers, he ought not to say, \u2018That\u2019s bad! That\u2019s bad!\u2019 Nothing God imposes on man is bad."}, {"text": " But it is all right to say, \u2018That\u2019s bitter! That\u2019s bitter!\u2019 For among medicines there are some that are made with bitter herbs.\u201d So, from the Judeo-Christian perspective, suffering can serve many purposes: it can test and potentially strengthen our faith, it can bring us closer to God in a very fundamental and intimate way, or it can loosen the bonds to the  \fmaterial world and make us cleave to God as our refuge."}, {"text": " While a person\u2019s religious tradition may offer valuable assistance in finding meaning, even those who do not subscribe to a religious worldview may upon careful reflection find meaning and value behind their suffering. Despite the universal unpleasantness, there is little doubt that our suffering can test, strengthen, and deepen the experience of life."}, {"text": " Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once said, \u201cWhat does not destroy me, makes me stronger.\u201d And while it is natural to recoil from suffering, suffering can also challenge us and at times even bring out the best in us. In The Third Man, author Graham Green observes, \u201cIn Italy for thirty years under the Borgias, they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed\u2014but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci,  \fand the Renaissance."}, {"text": " In Switzerland, they have brotherly love, five hundred years of democracy and peace, and what did they produce?

Robert was the CEO of a very successful corporation."}, {"text": " Several years ago, he suffered a serious financial setback that triggered a severe immobilizing depression. We met one  \fday during the depths of his depression. I had always known Robert to be the model of confidence and enthusiasm, and I was alarmed to see him looking so despondent.

I didn\u2019t know that it was even possible to feel so overwhelmed and hopeless and out of control.\u201d After discussing his difficulties for a while, I referred him to a colleague for treatment of his depression. Several weeks later, I ran into Robert\u2019s wife Karen and asked her how he was doing."}, {"text": " \u201cHe\u2019s doing much better thanks. The psychiatrist you recommended prescribed an antidepressant medication which is helping a lot.

I ended up just holding him in my arms for hours while he wept, until he finally fell asleep."}, {"text": " In twenty-three years of marriage, that\u2019s the first time something like that has happened ... and to be honest I\u2019ve never felt so close to him in my life.

Something seemed to just break open ... and that feeling of closeness is still there."}, {"text": " The fact that he shared his problem and we went through it together  \fsomehow changed our relationship, made us much closer.\u201d In searching for ways that one\u2019s personal suffering can take on meaning, we turn once again to the Dalai Lama, who illustrated how suffering can be put to practical use within the context of the Buddhist path."}, {"text": " \u201cIn Buddhist practice, you can use your personal suffering in a formal way to enhance your compassion\u2014by using it as an opportunity for the practice of Tong-Len. This is a Mahayana visualization practice in which one mentally visualizes taking on another\u2019s pain and suffering, and in turn giving them all of your resources, good health, fortune, and so on."}, {"text": " I will give instruction on this practice in greater detail later on. So, in doing this practice, when you undergo illness, pain, or suffering, you can use that as an  \fopportunity by thinking, \u2018May my suffering be a substitute for the suffering of all other sentient beings. By experiencing this, may I be able to save all other sentient beings who may have to undergo similar suffering."}, {"text": "\u2019 So you use your suffering as an opportunity for the practice of taking others\u2019 suffering upon yourself. \u201cHere, I should point out one thing. If, for instance, you become ill and practice this technique, thinking, \u2018May my illness act as a substitute for others who are suffering from similar illnesses,\u2019 and you visualize taking on their illness and suffering and giving them your good health, I\u2019m not suggesting that you ignore your own health."}, {"text": " When dealing with illnesses, first of all it\u2019s important to take preventative measures so you don\u2019t suffer from these illnesses, like taking all the precautionary measures such as adopting  \fthe right diet or whatever it may be. And then when you become ill, it is important not to overlook the necessity of taking the appropriate medications and all the other methods that are conventional."}, {"text": " \u201cHowever, once you do become ill, practices such as Tong-Len can make a significant difference in how you respond to the situation of illness in terms of your mental attitude. Instead of moaning about your situation, feeling sorry for yourself, and being overwhelmed by anxiety and worry, you can, in fact, save yourself from additional mental pain and suffering by adopting the right attitude."}, {"text": " Practicing Tong-Len meditation, or \u2018giving and receiving,\u2019 may not necessarily succeed in alleviating the real physical pain or lead to a cure in physical terms, but what it can do is protect you from unnecessary  \fadditional psychological pain, suffering, and anguish. You can think, \u2018May I, by experiencing this pain and suffering, be able to help other people and save others who may have to go through the same experience."}, {"text": "\u2019 Then your suffering takes on new meaning as it is used as the basis for a religious or spiritual practice. And on top of that, it is also possible in the cases of some individuals practicing this technique, that instead of being sorry and saddened by the experience, the person can see it as a kind of privilege."}, {"text": " The person can perceive it as a kind of opportunity and, in fact, be joyful because this particular experience has made him or her richer.\u201d \u201cYou mention that suffering can be used in the practice of Tong-Len.

So as an aid in helping us connect with others, it can be seen as having value. \u201cSo,\u201d the Dalai Lama concluded, \u201clooking at suffering in these ways, our attitude may begin to change; our suffering may not be as worthless and bad as we think."}, {"text": "\u201d  \fDEALING WITH PHYSICAL PAIN  By reflecting on suffering during the quieter moments of our lives, when things are relatively stable and going well, we may often discover a deeper value and meaning in our suffering. Sometimes, however, we may be confronted with kinds of suffering that seem to have no purpose, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever."}, {"text": " Physical pain and suffering often seem to belong to that category. But there is a difference between physical pain, which is a physiological process, and suffering, which is our mental and emotional response to the pain. So, the questions arises: Can finding an underlying purpose and meaning behind our pain modify our attitude  \fabout it? And can a change in attitude lessen the degree to which we suffer when we are physically injured? In his book, Pain: The Gift Nobody Wants, Dr."}, {"text": " Paul Brand explores the purpose and value of physical pain. Dr. Brand, a world-renowned hand surgeon and leprosy specialist, spent his early years in India where, as the son of missionaries, he was surrounded by people living under conditions of extreme hardship and suffering. Noticing that physical pain seemed to be expected and tolerated much more than in the West, Dr."}, {"text": " Brand became interested in the pain system in the human body. Eventually, he began working with leprosy patients in India and made a remarkable discovery. He found that the ravages of leprosy and the horrible disfigurements were not due to the disease organism directly  \fcausing the rotting of the flesh, but rather it was because the disease caused loss of pain sensation in the limbs."}, {"text": " Without the protection of pain, the leprosy patients lacked the system to warn them of tissue damage. Thus, Dr. Brand observed patients walking or running on limbs with broken skin or even exposed bones; this caused continuous deterioration. Without pain, sometimes they would even stick their hands in a fire to retrieve something."}, {"text": " He noticed an utter nonchalance toward self-destruction. In his book, Dr. Brand recounted story after story of the devastating effects of living without pain sensation \u2014of the repetitive injuries, of cases of rats gnawing off fingers and toes while the patient slept peacefully. After a lifetime of working with patients suffering from pain and those suffering from lack  \fof pain, Dr."}, {"text": " Brand gradually came to view pain not as the universal enemy as seen in the West but as a remarkable, elegant, and sophisticated biological system that warns us of damage to our body and thus protects us. But why must the experience of pain be so unpleasant? He concluded that the very unpleasantness of pain, the part that we hate, is what makes it so effective in protecting us and warning us of danger and injury."}, {"text": " The unpleasant quality of pain forces the entire human organism to attend to the problem. Although the body has automatic reflexive movements that form an outer layer of protection and move us quickly away from the pain, it is the feeling of unpleasantness that galvanizes and compels the entire organism to attend and act."}, {"text": " It also sears the experience into the memory and serves to protect us in the future.  \fIn the same way that finding meaning in our suffering can help us cope with life\u2019s problems, Dr. Brand feels that an understanding of the purpose of physical pain can lessen our suffering when pain arises. In view of this theory, he offers the concept of \u201cpain insurance."}, {"text": "\u201d He feels that we can prepare for pain ahead of time, while healthy, by gaining insight into the reason we have it and taking the time to reflect on what life would be without pain. However, since acute pain can demolish objectivity, we must reflect on these things before pain strikes. But if we can begin to think of pain as a \u201cspeech your body is delivering about a subject that is of vital importance to you, in the most effective way of getting your attention,\u201d then our attitude about pain will begin to change."}, {"text": " And as our attitude about pain changes, our suffering will diminish. As Dr. Brand  \fstates, \u201cI am convinced that the attitude we cultivate in advance may well determine how suffering will affect us when it does strike.\u201d He believes that we can even develop gratitude in the face of pain. We may not be grateful for the experience of pain, but we can be grateful for the system of pain perception."}, {"text": " There is no doubt that our attitude and mental outlook can strongly affect the degree to which we suffer when we are in physical pain. Let\u2019s say, for instance, that two individuals, a construction worker and a concert pianist, suffer the same finger injury. While the amount of physical pain might be the same for both individuals, the construction worker might suffer very little and in fact rejoice if the injury resulted in a month of paid vacation which he or she was in need of, whereas the same injury could result  \fin intense suffering to the pianist who viewed playing as his or her primary source of joy in life."}, {"text": " The idea that our mental attitude influences our ability to perceive and endure pain isn\u2019t limited to theoretical situations such as this; it has been demonstrated by many scientific studies and experiments. Researchers looking into this issue began by tracing the pathways of how pain is perceived and experienced."}, {"text": " Pain begins with a sensory signal\u2014an alarm that goes off when nerve endings are stimulated by something that is sensed as dangerous. Millions of signals are sent through the spinal cord to the base of the brain. These signals are then sorted out and a message is sent to higher areas of the brain telling of pain."}, {"text": " The brain then sorts through the prescreened messages and decides on a response. It is at this stage that the mind can assign value and meaning  \fto the pain and intensify or modify our perception of pain;we convert pain into suffering in the mind. To lessen the suffering of pain, we need to make a crucial distinction between the pain of pain and the pain we create by our thoughts about the pain."}, {"text": " Fear, anger, guilt, loneliness, and helplessness are all mental and emotional responses that can intensify pain. So, in developing an approach to dealing with pain, we can of course work at the lower levels of pain perception, using the tools of modern medicine such as medications and other procedures, but we can also work at the higher levels by modifying our outlook and attitude."}, {"text": " Many researchers have examined the role of the mind in the perception of pain. Pavlov even trained dogs to overcome the pain instinct by associating an electrical shock with a food  \freward. Researcher Ronald Melzak took Pavlov\u2019s experiments a step further. He raised Scottish terrier pups in a padded environment in which they wouldn\u2019t encounter the normal knocks and scrapes of growing up."}, {"text": " These dogs failed to learn basic responses to pain; they failed to react, for instance, when their paws were pricked with a pin, as opposed to their littermates who squealed with pain when pricked. On the basis of experiments such as these, he concluded that much of what we call pain, including the unpleasant emotional response, was learned rather than instinctive."}, {"text": " Other experiments with human beings, involving hypnosis and placebos, have also demonstrated that in many cases the higher brain functions can overrule the pain signals from the lower stages on the pain pathway. This indicates how the mind can often  \fdetermine how we perceive pain and helps explain the interesting findings of investigators such as Dr."}, {"text": " Richard Sternback and Bernard Tursky at Harvard Medical School (and later reaffirmed in a study by Dr. Maryann Bates et al.) who noted that there were significant differences among different ethnic groups in their ability to perceive and withstand pain. So it seems that the assertion that our attitude about pain can influence the degree to which we suffer is not simply based on philosophical speculation but is backed up by scientific evidence."}, {"text": " And if our investigation into the meaning and value of pain results in a change of attitude about pain, our efforts will not be wasted. In seeking to discover an underlying purpose of our pain, Dr. Brand makes one additional fascinating and critical observation. He  \fdescribes many reports of leprosy patients\u2019 claiming, \u201cOf course, I can see my hands and my feet, but somehow they don\u2019t feel like part of me."}, {"text": " It feels as if they are just tools.\u201d Thus, pain not only warns us and protects us, but it unifies us. Without pain sensation in our hands or feet, those parts no longer seem to belong to our body. In the same way that physical pain unifies our sense of having a body, we can conceive of the general experience of suffering acting as a unifying force that connects us with others."}, {"text": " Perhaps that is the ultimate meaning behind our suffering. It is our suffering that is the most basic element that we share with others, the factor that unifies us with all living creatures.  \fWe conclude our discussion of human suffering with the Dalai Lama\u2019s instruction on the practice of Tong-Len, which he referred to in our earlier conversation."}, {"text": " As he will explain, the purpose of this visualization meditation is to strengthen one\u2019s compassion. But it can also be seen as a powerful tool in helping transmute one\u2019s personal suffering. When undergoing any form of suffering or hardship, one can use this practice to enhance one\u2019s compassion by visualizing relieving others who are going through similar suffering, by absorbing and dissolving their suffering into your own\u2014a kind of suffering by proxy."}, {"text": " The Dalai Lama presented this instruction before a large audience on a particularly hot September afternoon in Tucson. The hall\u2019s air conditioning units, struggling against the soaring  \fdesert temperatures outside, were ultimately overcome by the additional heat generated by sixteen hundred bodies."}, {"text": " Temperatures in the room began to climb, creating a general level of discomfort that was particularly appropriate for the practice of a meditation on suffering.  \fThe Practice of Tong-Len  \u201cThis afternoon, let us meditate on the practice of Tong-Len, \u2018Giving and Receiving.\u2019 This practice is meant to help train the mind, to strengthen the natural power and force of compassion."}, {"text": " This is achieved because Tong-Len meditation helps counteract our selfishness. It increases the power and strength of our mind by enhancing our courage to open ourselves to others\u2019 suffering. \u201cTo begin this exercise, first visualize on one side of you a group of people who are in desperate need of help, those who are in an unfortunate state of suffering, those living under conditions of poverty, hardship, and pain."}, {"text": " Visualize this group of people on one side of you  \fclearly in your mind. Then, on the other side, visualize yourself as the embodiment of a selfcentered person, with a customary selfish attitude, indifferent to the well-being and needs of others. And then in between this suffering group of people and this selfish representation of you see yourself in the middle, as a neutral observer."}, {"text": " \u201cNext, notice which side you are naturally inclined towards. Are you more inclined towards that single individual, the embodiment of selfishness? Or do your natural feelings of empathy reach out to the group of weaker people who are in need? If you look objectively, you can see that the well-being of a group or large number of individuals is more important than that of one single individual."}, {"text": " \u201cAfter that, focus your attention on the needy and desperate people. Direct all your positive  \fenergy to them. Mentally give them your successes, your resources, your collection of virtues. And after you have done that, visualize taking upon yourself their suffering, their problems, and all their negativities."}, {"text": " \u201cFor example, you can visualize an innocent starving child from Somalia and feel how you would respond naturally towards that sight. In this instance, when you experience a deep feeling of empathy towards the suffering of that individual, it isn\u2019t based on considerations like\u2018He\u2019s my relative\u2019 or \u2019She\u2019s my friend."}, {"text": "\u2018 You don\u2019t even know that person. But the fact that the other person is a human being and you, yourself, are a human being allows your natural capacity for empathy to emerge and enable you to reach out. So you can visualize something like that and think, \u2019This child has no capacity of his  \for her own to be able to relieve himself or herself from his or her present state of difficulty or hardship."}, {"text": "\u2018 Then, mentally take upon yourself all the suffering of poverty, starvation, and the feeling of deprivation, and mentally give your facilities, wealth, and success to this child. So, through practicing this kind of \u2019giving-andreceiving\u2019 visualization, you can train your mind. \u201cWhen engaging in this practice it is sometimes helpful to begin by first imagining your own future suffering and, with an attitude of compassion, take your own future suffering upon yourself right now, with the sincere wish of freeing yourself from all future suffering."}, {"text": " After you gain some practice in generating a compassionate state of mind towards yourself, you can then expand the process to include taking on the suffering of others.  \f\u201cWhen you do the visualization of\u2018taking upon yourself,\u2019 it is useful to visualize these sufferings, problems, and difficulties in the form of poisonous substances, dangerous weapons, or terrifying animals\u2014things the very sight of which normally makes you shudder."}, {"text": " So, visualize the suffering in these forms, and then absorb them directly into your heart. \u201cThe purpose of visualizing these negative and frightening forms being dissolved into our hearts is to destroy our habitual selfish attitudes that reside there. However, for those individuals who may have problems with self-image, self-hatred, anger towards themselves, or low self-esteem, then it is important to judge for themselves whether this particular practice is appropriate or not."}, {"text": " It may not be. \u201cThis Tong-Len practice can become quite  \fpowerful if you combine the\u2018giving andreceiving\u2019 with the breath; that is, imagine\u2019 receiving\u2019 when inhaling and\u2019giving\u2019 when exhaling. When you do this visualization effectively, it will make you feel some slight discomfort. That is an indication that it is hitting its target\u2014the self-centered, egocentric attitude that we normally have."}, {"text": " Now, let us meditate.\u201d  At the conclusion of his instruction on Tong-Len, the Dalai Lama made an important point. No particular exercise will appeal to or be appropriate for everyone. In our spiritual journey it\u2019s important for each of us to decide whether a particular practice is appropriate for us."}, {"text": "  \fSometimes a practice will not appeal to us initially, and before it can be effective, we need to understand it better. This certainly was the case for me when I followed the Dalai Lama\u2019s instruction on Tong-Len that afternoon.

Next, one transforms determination into action\u2014the strong determination to change enables one to make a sustained effort to implement the actual changes.

I think, for instance, that information and public education about the harmful effects of smoking have modified people\u2019s behavior; I think that now many fewer people smoke in Western countries than in a communist country like China because of the availability of information."}, {"text": " But that learning alone is often not sufficient. You have to increase that awareness until it leads to a firm conviction about the harmful effects of smoking. This strengthens your determination to change. Finally, you must exert the effort to establish new habit patterns.

This can apply to other problems that we face as well.\u201d \u201cBut sometimes, even having information, we still might not have the energy to change."}, {"text": " How can we overcome that?\u201d I asked. The Dalai Lama paused to think, then said, \u201cI  \fthink that there might be different categories here. One kind may arise out of some biological factors that may be contributing to the apathy or lack of energy. When the cause of one\u2019s apathy or lack of energy is due to biological factors, one may need to work on one\u2019s lifestyle."}, {"text": " So, if one tries to get sufficient sleep, eat a healthy diet, abstain from alcohol, and so on, these kinds of things will help make one\u2019s mind more alert. And in some cases one may even need to resort to medication or other physical remedies if the cause is due to illness. But then there\u2019s another kind of apathy or laziness\u2014the kind that arises purely out of a certain weakness of mind ."}, {"text": "..\u201d \u201cYes, that\u2019s the kind I was referring to ...\u201d \u201cTo overcome that kind of apathy and to generate commitment and enthusiasm to overcome negative behaviors or states of mind,  \fonce again I think the most effective method, and perhaps the only solution, is to be constantly aware of the destructive effects of the negative behavior."}, {"text": " One may need to repeatedly remind oneself of those destructive effects.\u201d The Dalai Lama\u2019s words rang true, yet as a psychiatrist, I was acutely aware of how strongly entrenched some negative behaviors and ways of thinking could become, how difficult it was for some people to change. Assuming that there were complex psy chodynamic factors at play, I had spent countless hours examining and dissecting patients\u2019 resistance to change."}, {"text": " Turning this over in my mind, I asked: \u201cPeople often want to make positive changes in their lives, engage in healthier behaviors, and so on. But sometimes there just seems to be a sort of inertia or resistance ... How would you  \fexplain how that occurs?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s quite easy ... ,\u201d he began casually."}, {"text": " EASY? \u201cIt\u2019s because we simply become habituated or accustomed to doing things in certain ways. And then, we become sort of spoiled, doing only the things that we like to do, that we are used to doing.\u201d \u201cBut how can we overcome that?\u201d \u201cBy using habituation to our advantage. Through constant familiarity, we can definitely establish new behavior patterns."}, {"text": " Here\u2019s an example : In Dharamsala I usually wake up and start the day at 3:30, although here in Arizona these days I wake up at 4:30; I get one more hour\u2019s sleep,\u201d he laughed. \u201cAt the beginning you need a little bit of effort to get used to this, but after a few months, it becomes sort of  \fa set routine and you don\u2019t need to make any special effort."}, {"text": " So even if you were to go to bed late, you might have a tendency to want a few more minutes\u2019 sleep, but you still get up at 3:30 without having to give special thought to it, and you can get up and do your daily practices. This is due to the force of habituation. \u201cSo, by making a steady effort, I think we can overcome any form of negative conditioning and make positive changes in our lives."}, {"text": " But you still need to realize that genuine change doesn\u2019t happen overnight. Now, for example, in my own case, I think if I compare my normal state of mind today to, say, twenty or thirty years ago, there\u2019s a big difference. But this difference, I came to step by step. I started to learn Buddhism around the age of five or six, but at that time I had no interest in Buddhist teachings,\u201d he  \flaughed, \u201calthough I was called the highest reincarnation."}, {"text": " I think it wasn\u2019t until I was around sixteen years old that I really began to have some serious feeling about Buddhism. And I tried to start serious practice. Then, over the course of many years, I began to develop a deep appreciation of Buddhist principles, and practices, which initially seemed so impossible and almost unnatural, became much more natural and easy to relate to."}, {"text": " This occurred through gradual familiarization. Of course, this process took more than forty years. \u201cSo, you see, deep down, mental development takes time. If someone says, \u2018Oh, through many years of hardship things have changed,\u2019 I can take that seriously. There\u2019s a greater likelihood of the changes being genuine and longlasting."}, {"text": " If someone says, \u2018Oh, within a  \fshort period, say two years, there has been a big change,\u2019 I think that is unrealistic.\u201d While the Dalai Lama\u2019s approach to change was unarguably reasonable, there was one matter that seemed to need to be reconciled: \u201cWell, you\u2019ve mentioned the need for a high level of enthusiasm and determination to transform one\u2019s mind, to make positive changes."}, {"text": " Yet at the same time we acknowledge that genuine change occurs slowly and can take a long time,\u201d I noted. \u201cWhen change takes place so slowly, it\u2019s easy to become discouraged. Haven\u2019t you ever felt discouraged by the slow rate of progress in relation to your spiritual practice or discouragement in other areas of your life?\u201d \u201cYes, certainly,\u201d he said."}, {"text": " \u201cHow do you deal with that?\u201d I asked. \u201cAs far as my own spiritual practice goes, if I  \fencounter some obstacles or problems, I find it helpful to stand back and take the longterm view rather than the short-term view. In this regard, I find that thinking about one particular verse gives me courage and helps me sustain my determination."}, {"text": " It says: As long as space endures As long as sentient beings remain May I too live To dispel the miseries of the world. \u201cHowever, as far as the struggle for the freedom of Tibet is concerned, if I utilize that kind of belief, those verses\u2014being prepared to wait \u2018eons and eons ... as long as space endures,\u2019 and so on\u2014then ) I think I would be foolish."}, {"text": " Here, one needs to take more immediate  \for active involvement. Of course, in that situation, the struggle for freedom, when I reflect on the fourteen or fifteen years of effort at negotiation with no results, when I think about the almost fifteen years of failure, I develop a certain feeling of impatience or frustration."}, {"text": " But this feeling of frustration doesn\u2019t discourage me to the point of losing hope.\u201d Pressing the issue a bit further, I asked, \u201cBut what exactly prevents you from losing hope?\u201d \u201cEven in the situation with Tibet, I think that viewing the situation from a wider perspective can definitely help."}, {"text": " So, for instance, if I look at the situation inside Tibet from a narrow perspective, focusing only on that, then the situation appears almost hopeless. However, if I look from a wider perspective, look from a world perspective, then I see the international  \fsituation in which whole communist and totalitarian systems are collapsing, where even in China there\u2019s a democracy movement, and the spirit of Tibetans remains high."}, {"text": " So, I don\u2019t give up.\u201d  Given his extensive background and training in Buddhist philosophy and meditation, it is interesting that the Dalai Lama identifies learning and education as the first step in bringing about internal transformation, rather than more transcendental or mystical spiritual practices."}, {"text": " Although education is commonly acknowledged as important in learning new skills or securing a good job, its role as a vital factor in achieving  \fhappiness is widely overlooked. Yet studies have shown that even purely academic education is directly linked to a happier life. Numerous surveys have conclusively found that higher levels of education have a positive correlation with better health and a longer life, and even protect an individual from depression."}, {"text": " In trying to determine the reasons for these beneficial effects of education, scientists have reasoned that bettereducated individuals are more aware of health risk factors, are better able to implement healthier lifestyle choices, feel a greater sense of empowerment and self-esteem, have greater problem-solving skills and more effective coping strategies\u2014all factors that can contribute to a happier, healthier life."}, {"text": " So, if merely academic education is associated with a happier life, how much more powerful can be the kind of learning  \fand education spoken of by the Dalai Lama\u2014 education that focuses specifically on understanding and implementing the full spectrum of factors that lead to lasting happiness? The next step in the Dalai Lama\u2019s path to change involves generating \u201cdetermination and enthusiasm."}, {"text": "\u201d This step is also widely accepted by contemporary Western science as an important factor in achieving one\u2019s goals. In one study, for instance, educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom examined the lives of some of America\u2019s most accomplished artists, athletes, and scientists. He discovered that drive and determination, not great natural talent, led to their success in their respective fields."}, {"text": " As in any other field, one could assume that this principle would equally apply to the art of achieving happiness. Behavioral scientists have extensively  \fresearched the mechanisms that initiate, sustain, and direct our activities, referring to this field as the study of \u201chuman motivation.\u201d Psychologists have identified three principle types of motives."}, {"text": " The first type, primary motives, are drives based on biological needs that must be met for survival. This would include, for example, needs for food, water, and air. Another category of motives involves a human being\u2019s need for stimulation and information. Investigators hypothesize that this is an innate need, required for proper maturation, development, and functioning of the nervous system."}, {"text": " The final category, called secondary motives, are motives based on learned needs and drives. Many secondary motives are related to acquired needs for success, power, status, or achievement. At this level of motivation, one\u2019s behavior and drives  \fcan be influenced by social forces and shaped by learning."}, {"text": " It is at this stage that the theories of modern psychology meet with the Dalai Lama\u2019s conception of developing \u201cdetermination and enthusiasm.\u201d In the Dalai Lama\u2019s system, however, the drive and determination generated are not used only in the pursuit of worldly success but develop as one gains a clearer understanding of the factors that lead to true happiness and are used in the pursuit of higher goals, such as kindness, compassion, and spiritual development."}, {"text": " \u201cEffort\u201d is the final factor in bringing about change. The Dalai Lama identifies effort as a necessary factor in establishing new conditioning. The idea that we can change our negative behaviors and thoughts through new conditioning is not only shared by Western psychologists, but  \fit is in fact the cornerstone of contemporary behavior therapy."}, {"text": " This kind of therapy is based on the basic theory that people have largely learned to be the way they are, and, by offering strategies to create new conditioning, behavior therapy has proven to be effective for a broad range of problems. While science has recently revealed that one\u2019s genetic predisposition clearly plays a role in an individual\u2019s characteristic way of responding to the world, most social scientists and psychologists feel that a large measure of the way we behave, think, and feel is determined by learning and conditioning, which comes about as a result of our upbringing and the social and cultural forces around us."}, {"text": " And since it is believed that behaviors are largely established by conditioning, and reinforced and amplified by  \f\u201chabituation,\u201d this opens up the possibility, as the Dalai Lama contends, of extinguishing harmful or negative conditioning and replacing it with helpful, life-enhancing conditioning."}, {"text": " Making a sustained effort to change external behavior is not only helpful in overcoming bad habits but also can change our underlying attitudes and feelings. Experiments have shown that not only do our attitudes and psychological traits determine our behavior, an idea that is commonly accepted, but our behavior can also change our attitudes."}, {"text": " Investigators found that even an artificially induced frown or smile tends to induce the corresponding emotions of anger or happiness; this suggests that just \u201cgoing through the motions\u201d and repeatedly engaging in a positive behavior can eventually bring about genuine internal change. This could have  \fimportant implications in the Dalai Lama\u2019s approach to building a happier life."}, {"text": " If we begin with the simple act of regularly helping others, for instance, even if we don\u2019t feel particularly kind or caring, we may discover an inner transformation is taking place, as we very gradually develop genuine feelings of compassion.  \fREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS  In bringing about genuine inner transformation and change, the Dalai Lama emphasizes the importance of making a sustained effort."}, {"text": " It is a gradual process. This is in sharp contrast to the proliferation of \u201cquick fix\u201d self-help techniques and therapies that have become so popular in Western culture in recent decades\u2014techniques ranging from \u201cpositive affirmations\u201d to \u201cdiscovering your inner child.\u201d The Dalai Lama\u2019s approach points toward slow growth and maturity."}, {"text": " He believes in the tremendous, perhaps even unlimited, power of the mind\u2014but a mind that has been systematically trained, focused, concentrated, a  \fmind tempered by years of experience and sound reasoning. It takes a long time to develop the behavior and habits of mind that contribute to our problems."}, {"text": " It takes an equally long time to establish the new habits that bring happiness. There is no getting around these essential ingredients: determination, effort, and time. These are the real secrets to happiness. When embarking on the path to change, it is important to set reasonable expectations. If our expectations are too high, we\u2019re setting ourselves up for disappointment."}, {"text": " If they are too low, it extinguishes our willingness to challenge our limitations and achieve our true potential. Following our conversation about the process of change, the Dalai Lama explained: \u201cYou should never lose sight of the importance of having a realistic attitude\u2014of being  \fvery sensitive and respectful to the concrete reality of your situation as you proceed on the path towards your ultimate goal."}, {"text": " Recognize the difficulties inherent in your path, and the fact that it may take time and a consistent effort. It\u2019s important to make a clear distinction in your mind between your ideals and the standards by which you judge your progress. As a Buddhist, for instance, you set your ideals very high: full Enlightenment is your ultimate expectation."}, {"text": " Holding full Enlightenment as your ideal of achievement is not an extreme. But expecting to achieve it quickly, here and now, becomes an extreme. Using that as a standard instead of your ideal causes you to become discouraged and completely lose hope when you don\u2019t quickly achieve Enlightenment. So you need a realistic approach."}, {"text": " On the other hand, if you say,  \f\u2018I\u2019m just going to focus on the here and now; that\u2019s the practical thing, and I don\u2019t care about the future or the ultimate attainment of Buddhahood,\u2019 then again, that is another extreme. So we need to find an approach that is somewhere in between. We need to find a balance."}, {"text": " \u201cDealing with expectations is really a tricky issue. If you have excessive expectations without a proper foundation, then that usually leads to problems. On the other hand, without expectation and hope, without aspiration, there can be no progress. Some hope is essential. So finding the proper balance is not easy."}, {"text": " One needs to judge each situation on the spot.\u201d I still had nagging doubts; although we may certainly modify some of our negative behaviors and attitudes given enough time and effort, to what extent is it truly possible to eradicate the  \fnegative emotions? Addressing the Dalai Lama, I began, \u201cWe\u2019ve spoken about the fact that ultimate happiness depends on eliminating our negative behaviors and mental states\u2014things like anger, hatred, greed, and so on."}, {"text": "..\u201d The Dalai Lama nodded. \u201cBut these kinds of emotions seem to be a natural part of our psychological makeup. All human beings seem to experience these darker emotions to one degree or another. And if that\u2019s the case, is it reasonable to hate, deny, and combat part of ourselves? I mean, it seems impractical, and even unnatural, to try to completely eradicate something that is an integral part of our natural makeup."}, {"text": "\u201d Shaking his head, the Dalai Lama replied, \u201cYes, some people suggest that anger, hatred, and other negative emotions are a natural part of  \four mind. They feel that since these are a natural part of our makeup, there is no way to really change these mental states. But that is wrong. Now, for example, all of us are born in an ignorant state."}, {"text": " In this sense, ignorance is also quite natural. Anyway, when we are young, we are quite ignorant. But as we grow, day by day through education and learning we can acquire knowledge and dispel ignorance. However, if we leave ourselves in an ignorant state without consciously developing our learning, we won\u2019t be able to dispel ignorance."}, {"text": " So, if we leave ourselves in a \u2018natural state\u2019 without making an effort to dispel it, then the opposing factors or forces of education and learning do not come naturally. And in the same way, through proper training we can gradually reduce our negative emotions and increase positive states of mind  \fsuch as love, compassion, and forgiveness."}, {"text": "\u201d \u201cBut if these things are a part of our psyche, ultimately how can we be successful in fighting against something which is part of ourselves?\u201d \u201cIn considering how to fight against the negative emotions, it is useful to know how the human mind works,\u201d answered the Dalai Lama. \u201cNow the human mind is of course very complex."}, {"text": " But it is also very skillful. It can find many ways in which it can deal with a variety of situations and conditions. For one thing, the mind has the ability to adopt different perspectives through which it can address various problems. \u201cWithin Buddhist practice, this ability to adopt different perspectives is utilized in a number of meditations in which you mentally isolate different aspects of yourself, then engage in a dialogue between them."}, {"text": " For instance, there is a meditation  \fpractice designed to enhance altruism, whereby you engage in a dialogue between your own \u2018self-centered attitude,\u2019 a self that is the embodiment of self-centeredness, and yourself as a spiritual practitioner. There is a kind of a dialogical relationship. So similarly here, although negative traits such as hatred and anger are part of your mind, you can engage in an endeavor in which you take your anger and hatred as an object and do combat with it."}, {"text": " \u201cIn addition, from your own daily experience, you often find yourself in situations in which you blame or criticize yourself. You say, \u2018Oh, on such and such day, I let myself down.\u2019 Then you criticize yourself. Or, you blame yourself for doing something wrong or for not doing something, and you feel angry towards yourself."}, {"text": " So here also, you engage in a kind of dialogue  \fwith yourself. In reality, there are not two distinct selves; it\u2019s just the one continuum of the same individual. But still, it makes sense to criticize yourself, to feel angry towards yourself. This is something that you all know from your own experience."}, {"text": " \u201cSo although, in reality, there is only one single individual continuum, you can adopt two different perspectives. What takes place when you are criticizing yourself? The \u2018self\u2019 that is criticizing is done from a perspective of yourself as a totality, your entire being, and the \u2019self\u2019 that is being criticized is a self from a perspective of a particular experience or a particular event."}, {"text": " So you can see the possibility of having this \u2018self-toself relationship.\u2019 \u201cTo expand on this point, it may be quite helpful to reflect upon the various aspects of  \fone\u2019s own personal identity. Let us take the example of a Tibetan Buddhist monk. That individual can have a sense of personalized identity from the perspective of his being a monk, \u2018myself as a monk."}, {"text": "\u2019 And then he can also have a level of personal identity that is not so much based upon his consideration of monkhood but rather of his ethnic origin, like Tibetan, so he can say, \u2018I as a Tibetan.\u2019 And then at another level, that person can have another identity in which monkhood and ethnic origin may not play any important role."}, {"text": " He can think, \u2018I as a human being.\u2019 So you can see different perspectives within each person\u2019s individual identity. \u201cWhat this indicates is that when we conceptually relate to something, we are capable of looking at one phenomenon from many different angles. And the capacity to see things  \ffrom different angles is quite selective; we can focus on a particular angle, a particular aspect of that phenomenon, and adopt a particular perspective."}, {"text": " This capacity becomes very important when we seek to identify and eliminate certain negative aspects of ourselves or enhance positive traits. Because of this capacity to adopt a different perspective, we can isolate parts of ourselves that we seek to eliminate and do battle with them. \u201cNow, in further examining this subject, a very important question arises: Although we may engage in combat with anger, hatred, and the other negative states of mind, what guarantee or assurance do we have that it is possible to gain victory over them? \u201cWhen speaking of these negative states of mind, I should point out that I am referring to  \fwhat are called Nyon Mong in Tibetan, or Klesha in Sanskrit."}, {"text": " This term literally means \u2018that which afflicts from within.\u2019 That\u2019s a long term, so it is often translated as \u2018delusions.\u2019 The very etymology of the Tibetan word Nyon Mong gives you a sense that it is an emotional and cognitive event that spontaneously afflicts your mind, destroys your peace of mind, or brings about a disturbance within your psyche when it arises."}, {"text": " If we pay close enough attention, it\u2019s easy to recognize the afflictive nature of these \u2018delusions\u2019 simply because they have this tendency to destroy our calmness and presence of mind. But it\u2019s much more difficult to find out whether we can overcome them. That is a question that directly relates to the whole idea of whether it is possible to attain the full realization of our spiritual potential."}, {"text": " And that is a very  \fserious and difficult question. \u201cSo, what grounds do we have to accept that these afflictive emotions and cognitive events, or \u2018delusions,\u2019 can be ultimately rooted out and eliminated from our minds? In Buddhist thought, we have three principal premises or grounds on which we believe that that can happen."}, {"text": " \u201cThe first premise is that all \u2018deluded\u2019 states of mind, all afflictive emotions and thoughts, are essentially distorted, in that they are rooted in misperceiving the actual reality of the situation. No matter how powerful, deep down these negative emotions have no valid foundation. They are based on ignorance."}, {"text": " On the other hand, all the positive emotions or states of mind, such as love, compassion, insight, and so on have a solid basis. When the mind is experiencing these positive states, there is no distortion. In addition,  \fthese positive factors are grounded in reality. They can be verified by our own experience."}, {"text": " There is a kind of grounding and rootedness in reason and understanding; this is not the case with afflictive emotions like anger and hatred. On top of that, all these positive states of mind have the quality that you can enhance their capacity and increase their potential to a limitless degree, if you regularly practice them through training and constant familiarity ."}, {"text": "..\u201d I interrupted, \u201cCan you explain a bit more what you mean by the positive states of mind having a \u2018valid basis,\u2019 and the negative states of mind having \u2018no valid basis\u2019?\u201d He clarified, \u201cWell, for example, compassion is considered a positive emotion. In generating compassion, you start by recognizing that you do not want suffering and that you have a right to  \fhave happiness."}, {"text": " This can be verified or validated by your own experience. You then recognize that other people, just like yourself, also do not want to suffer and they have the right to have happiness. This becomes the basis of your beginning to generate compassion. \u201cEssentially, there are two kinds of emotions or states of mind: positive and negative."}, {"text": " One way of categorizing these emotions is in terms of understanding that the positive emotions are those which can be justified, and the negative emotions are those which cannot be justified. For instance, earlier we discussed the topic of desire, how there can be positive desires and negative desires."}, {"text": " Desire for one\u2019s basic necessities to be met is a positive kind of desire. It is justifiable. It is based on the fact that we all exist and have the right to survive. And in order to survive, there are  \fcertain things that we require, certain needs that have to be met. So that kind of desire has a valid foundation."}, {"text": " And, as we discussed, there are other types of desire that are negative, like excessive desire and greed. Those kinds of desires are not based on valid reasons, and often just create trouble and complicate one\u2019s life. Those kinds of desires are simply based on a feeling of discontentment, of wanting more, even though the things we want aren\u2019t really necessary."}, {"text": " Those kinds of desires have no solid reasons behind them. So, in this way we can say that the positive emotions have a firm and valid foundation, and the negative emotions lack this valid foundation.\u201d  \fThe Dalai Lama continued his examination of the human mind, dissecting the workings of the mind with the same scrutiny that a botanist might use in classifying species of rare flowers."}, {"text": " \u201cNow this brings us to the second premise on which we base the claim that our negative emotions can be rooted out and eliminated. This premise is based on the fact that our positive states of mind can act as antidotes to our negative tendencies and delusory states of mind. So, the second premise is that as you enhance the capacity of these antidotal factors, the greater their force, the more you will be able to reduce the force of the mental and emotional afflictions, the more you will be able to reduce the influences and effects of these  \fthings."}, {"text": " \u201cWhen talking about eliminating negative states of mind, there is one point that should be born in mind. Within Buddhist practice, the cultivation of certain specific positive mental qualities such as patience, tolerance, kindness, and so on can act as specific antidotes to negative states of mind such as anger, hatred, and attachment."}, {"text": " Applying antidotes such as love and compassion can significantly reduce the degree or influence of the mental and emotional afflictions, but since they seek to eliminate only certain specific or individual afflictive emotions, in some sense they can be seen as only partial measures. These afflictive emotions, such as attachment and hatred, are ultimately rooted in ignorance\u2014 misconception of the true nature of reality."}, {"text": " Therefore, there seems to be a consensus among  \fall Buddhist traditions that in order to fully overcome all of these negative tendencies, one must apply the antidote to ignorance\u2014the \u2018Wisdom factor. \u2019This is indispensable. The \u2018Wisdom factor\u2019 involves generating insight into the true nature of reality."}, {"text": " \u201cSo, within the Buddhist tradition, we not only have specific antidotes for specific states of mind, for example, patience and tolerance act as specific antidotes to anger and hatred, but we also have a general antidote\u2014insight into the ultimate nature of reality\u2014that acts as an antidote to all of the negative states of mind."}, {"text": " It is similar to getting rid of a poisonous plant: you can eliminate the harmful effects by cutting off the specific branches and leaves, or you can eliminate the entire plant by going to the root and uprooting it.\u201d  \fConcluding his discussion about the possibility of eliminating our negative mental states, the Dalai Lama explained, \u201cThe third premise is that the essential nature of mind is pure."}, {"text": " It is based on the belief that the underlying basic subtle consciousness is untainted by the negative emotions. Its nature is pure, a state which is referred to as the \u2018mind of Clear Light.\u2019 That basic nature of the mind is also called Buddha Nature. So, since the negative emotions are not an intrinsic part of this Buddha Nature, there is a possibility to eliminate them and purify the mind."}, {"text": " \u201cSo it is on these three premises that  \fBuddhism accepts that the mental and emotional afflictions ultimately can be eliminated through deliberately cultivating antidotal forces like love, compassion, tolerance, and forgiveness, and through various practices such as meditation.\u201d The idea that the underlying nature of the mind is pure and we have the capacity to completely eliminate our negative patterns of thinking was a topic that I had heard the Dalai Lama speak of before."}, {"text": " He had compared the mind to a glass of muddy water; the afflictive mental states were like the \u201cimpurities\u201d or the mud, which could be removed to reveal the underlying \u201cpure\u2019 nature of the water. This seemed a little abstract, so moving on to more practical concerns, I interrupted. \u201cLet\u2019s say that one accepts the possibility of eliminating one\u2019s negative emotions, and even  \fbegins to take steps in that direction."}, {"text": " From our discussions, however, I sense that it would take tremendous effort to eradicate this dark side\u2014 tremendous study, contemplation, constant application of antidotal factors, intensive meditation practices, and so on. That might be appropriate for a monk or someone who can devote a lot of time and attention to these practices."}, {"text": " But what about an ordinary person, with a family and so on, who may not have the time or opportunity to practice these intensive techniques? For them, wouldn\u2019t it be more appropriate to simply try to control their afflictive emotions, to learn to live with them and manage them properly, rather than to try to completely eradicate them? It\u2019s like patients with diabetes."}, {"text": " They may not have the means of a complete cure, but by watching their diet, taking insulin,  \fand so on, they can control the disease and prevent the symptoms and the negative sequelae of the disease.\u201d \u201cYes, that\u2019s the way!\u201d he enthusiastically responded. \u201cI agree with you.

However, it is also possible for a layperson to attain high levels of spiritual realization\u2014someone who has a job, a family, a sexual relationship with one\u2019s spouse, and so on.

Many in the West turn to religious beliefs as a source of happiness, yet the Dalai Lama\u2019s approach is fundamentally different from many Western religions in that it relies more heavily on reasoning and training the mind than on faith."}, {"text": " In some respects, the Dalai Lama\u2019s approach resembles a mind science, a system that one could apply in much the same way as people utilize psychotherapy. But what the Dalai Lama  \fsuggests goes further. While we\u2019re used to the idea of using psychotherapeutic techniques such as behavior therapy to attack specific bad habits \u2014smoking, drinking, temper flares\u2014we are not accustomed to cultivating positive attributes\u2014 love, compassion, patience, generosity\u2014as weapons against all negative emotions and mental states."}, {"text": " The Dalai Lama\u2019s method for achieving happiness is based on the revolutionary idea that negative mental states are not an intrinsic part of our minds; they are transient obstacles that obstruct the expression of our underlying natural state of joy and happiness. Most traditional schools of Western psychotherapy tend to focus on adjusting to one\u2019s neurosis rather than a complete overhaul of one\u2019s entire outlook."}, {"text": " They explore the individual\u2019s personal history, relationships, day-  \fto-day experiences (including dreams and fantasies), and even the relationship with the therapist in an attempt to resolve the patient\u2019s internal conflicts, unconscious motives, and psychological dynamics that may be contributing to his or her problems and unhappiness."}, {"text": " The goal is to achieve healthier coping strategies, adjustment, and amelioration of symptoms, rather than directly training the mind to be happy. The most distinguishing feature of the Dalai Lama\u2019s method of training the mind involves the idea that positive states of mind can act as direct antidotes to negative states of mind."}, {"text": " In looking for parallels to this approach in modern behavioral science, cognitive therapy perhaps comes closest. This form of psychotherapy has become increasingly popular over the past few decades and has been proven to be very  \feffective in treating a wide variety of common problems, particularly mood disorders such as depression and anxiety."}, {"text": " Modern cognitive therapy, developed by psychotherapists such as Dr. Albert Ellis and Dr. Aaron Beck, is based on the idea that our upsetting emotions and maladaptive behaviors are caused by distortions in thinking and irrational beliefs. The therapy focuses on helping the patient systematically identify, examine, and correct these distortions in thinking."}, {"text": " The corrective thoughts, in a sense, become an antidote to the distorted thinking patterns that are the source of the patient\u2019s suffering. For example, a person is rejected by another and responds with excessive feelings of hurt. The cognitive therapist first helps the person identify the underlying irrational belief: for example, \u201cI  \fmust be loved and approved of by almost every significant person in my life at all times, or if not it\u2019s horrible and I\u2019m unworthy."}, {"text": "\u201d The therapist then presents the person with evidence that challenges this unrealistic belief. Although this approach may seem superficial, many studies have shown that cognitive therapy works. In depression, for instance, cognitive therapists argue that it is one\u2019s negative self-defeating thoughts that underlie the depression."}, {"text": " In much the same way that Buddhists view all afflictive emotions as distorted, cognitive therapists view these negative depression-generating thoughts as \u201cessentially distorted.\u201d In depression, thinking can become distorted by viewing events in all-ornothing terms or overgen eralizing (e.g., if you lose a job or fail a class, you automatically think, \u201cI\u2019m a total failure!\u201d) or by selectively perceiving  \fonly certain events (e."}, {"text": "g., three good things and two bad things may happen in one day, but the depressed person ignores the good and focuses only on the bad). So in treating the depression, with the help of the therapist the patient is encouraged to monitor the automatic arising of negative thoughts (e.g., \u201cI\u2019m completely worthless\u201d) and actively correct these distorted thoughts by gathering information and evidence that contradict or disprove it (e."}, {"text": "g., \u201cI have worked hard to raise two children,\u201d \u201cI have a talent for singing,\u201d \u201cI have been a good friend,\u201d \u201cI have held down a difficult job,\u201d etc.).

All  \fnegative mental states act as obstacles to our happiness, but we begin with anger, which seems to be one of the biggest blocks."}, {"text": " It is described by the Stoic philosopher Seneca as \u201cthe most hideous and frenzied of all the emotions.\u201d The destructive effects of anger and hatred have been well documented by recent scientific studies. Of course, one doesn\u2019t need scientific evidence to realize how these emotions can cloud our judgment, cause feelings of extreme discomfort, or wreak havoc in our personal relationships."}, {"text": " Our personal experience can tell us that. But in recent years, great inroads have been made in documenting the harmful physical effects of anger and hostility. Dozens of studies have shown these emotions to be a significant cause of disease and premature death. Investigators such as Dr. Redford Williams at Duke University and Dr."}, {"text": "  \fRobert Sapolsky at Stanford University have conducted studies that demonstrate that anger, rage, and hostility are particularly damaging to the cardiovascular system. So much evidence has mounted about the harmful effects of hostility, in fact, that it is now considered a major risk factor in heart disease, at least equal to, or perhaps greater than, the traditionally recognized risk factors such as high cholesterol or high blood pressure."}, {"text": " So, once we accept the harmful effects of anger and hatred, the next question becomes: how do we overcome it? On my first day as a psychiatric consultant to a treatment facility, I was being shown to my new office by a staff member when I heard bloodcurdling screams reverberating down the hall ... \u201cI\u2019m angry."}, {"text": "..\u201d  \f\u201cLouder!\u201d \u201cI\u2019M ANGRY!\u201d \u201cLOUDER!

She appeared drained. \u201cI feel so relaxed,\u201d she said, \u201cthat therapy session really worked. I feel as if I\u2019ve gotten all my anger out."}, {"text": "\u201d In our next session the following day,  \fhowever, the patient reported, \u201cWell, I guess I didn\u2019t get all my anger out after all. Right after I left here yesterday, as I was pulling out of the parking lot some jerk almost cut me off ... and I was furious! And I kept cursing that jerk under my breath all the way home."}, {"text": " I guess I still need a few more of those anger sessions to get the rest of it out.\u201d  In setting out to conquer anger and hatred, the Dalai Lama begins by investigating the nature of these destructive emotions. \u201cGenerally speaking,\u201d he explained, \u201cthere are  \fmany different kinds of afflictive or negative emotions, such as conceit, arrogance, jealousy, desire, lust, closed-mindedness, and so on."}, {"text": " But out of all these, hatred and anger are considered to be the greatest evils because they are the greatest obstacles to developing compassion and altruism, and they destroy one\u2019s virtue and calmness of mind. \u201cIn thinking about anger, there can be two types. One type of anger can be positive. This would be mainly due to one\u2019s motivation."}, {"text": " There can be some anger that is motivated by compassion or a sense of responsibility. Where anger is motivated by compassion, it can be used as an impetus or a catalyst for a positive action. Under these circumstances, a human emotion like anger can act as a force to bring about swift action. It creates a kind of energy that enables an  \findividual to act quickly and decisively."}, {"text": " It can be a powerful motivating factor. So, sometimes that kind of anger can be positive. All too often, however, even though that kind of anger can act as a kind of protector and bring one extra energy, that energy is also blind, so it is uncertain whether it will become constructive or destructive in the end."}, {"text": " \u201cSo, even though under rare circumstances some kinds of anger can be positive, generally speaking, anger leads to ill feeling and hatred. And, as far as hatred is concerned, it is never positive. It has no benefit at all. It is always totally negative. \u201cWe cannot overcome anger and hatred simply by suppressing them."}, {"text": " We need to actively cultivate the antidotes to hatred: patience and tolerance. Following the model that we spoke of  \fearlier, in order for you to be able to successfully cultivate patience and tolerance you need to generate enthusiasm, a strong desire to seek it. The stronger your enthusiasm, the greater your ability to withstand the hardships that you encounter in the process."}, {"text": " When you are engaged in the practice of patience and tolerance, in reality, what is happening is you are engaged in a combat with hatred and anger. Since it is a situation of combat, you seek victory, but you also have to be prepared for the possibility of losing that battle. So while you are engaged in combat, you should not lose sight of the fact that in the process, you will confront many problems."}, {"text": " You should have the ability to withstand these hardships. Someone who gains victory over hatred and anger through such an arduous process is a true hero.  \f\u201cIt is with this in mind that we generate this strong enthusiasm. Enthusiasm results from learning about and reflecting upon the beneficial effects of tolerance and patience, and the destructive and negative effects of anger and hatred."}, {"text": " And that very act, that very realization in itself, will create an affinity towards feelings of tolerance and patience and make you feel more cautious and wary of angry and hateful thoughts. Usually, we don\u2019t bother much about anger or hatred, so it just comes. But once we develop a cautious attitude towards these emotions, that reluctant attitude itself can act as a preventative measure against anger or hatred."}, {"text": " \u201cThe destructive effects of hatred are very visible, very obvious and immediate. For example, when a very strong or forceful thought of hatred arises within you, at that very instant, it  \ftotally overwhelms you and destroys your peace of mind; your presence of mind disappears completely. When such intense anger and hatred arises, it obliterates the best part of your brain, which is the ability to judge between right and wrong, and the long-term and short-term consequences of your actions."}, {"text": " Your power of judgment becomes totally inoperable; it can no longer function. It is almost like you have become insane. So, this anger and hatred tends to throw you into a state of confusion, which just serves to make your problems and difficulties so much worse. \u201cEven at the physical level, hatred brings about a very ugly, unpleasant physical transformation of the individual."}, {"text": " At the very instant when strong feelings of anger or hatred arise, no matter how hard the person tries to  \fpretend or adopt a dignified pose, it is very obvious that the person\u2019s face looks contorted and ugly. There is a very unpleasant expression, and the person gives out a very hostile vibration."}, {"text": " Other people can sense it. It is almost as if they can feel steam coming out of that person\u2019s body. So much so, that not only are human beings capable of sensing it, but even animals, pets, would try to avoid the person at that instant. Also, when a person harbors hateful thoughts, they tend to collect inside the person, and this can cause things like loss of appetite, loss of sleep, and certainly make the person feel more tense and uptight."}, {"text": " \u201cFor reasons such as these, hatred is compared to an enemy. This internal enemy, this inner enemy, has no other function than causing us harm. It is our true enemy, our ultimate enemy.  \fIt has no other function than simply destroying us, both in the immediate term and in the long term. \u201cThis is very different from an ordinary enemy."}, {"text": " Although an ordinary enemy, a person whom we regard as an enemy, may engage in activities that are harmful to us, at least he or she has other functions; that person has got to eat, and that person has got to sleep. So he or she has many other functions and therefore cannot devote twenty-four hours a day of his or her existence to this project of destroying us."}, {"text": " On the other hand, hatred has no other function, no other purpose, than destroying us. So, by realizing this fact, we should resolve that we will never give an opportunity for this enemy, hatred, to arise within us.\u201d \u201cIn dealing with anger, what do you think about some of the methods of Western  \fpsychotherapy, which encourage expressing one\u2019s anger?\u201d \u201cHere, I think we have to understand that there may be different situations,\u201d the Dalai Lama explained."}, {"text": " \u201cIn some cases, people harbor strong feelings of anger and hurt based on something done to them in the past, an abuse or whatever, and that feeling is kept bottled up. There is a Tibetan expression that says that if there is any sickness in the conch shell, you can clear it by blowing it out. In other words, if anything is blocking the conch shell, just blow it out, and it will be clear."}, {"text": " So similarly here, it is possible to imagine a situation in which, due to the bottling up of certain emotions or certain feelings of anger, it may be better to just let it out and express it. \u201cHowever, I believe that generally speaking, anger and hatred are the type of emotions which,  \fif you leave them unchecked or unattended, tend to aggravate and keep on increasing."}, {"text": " If you simply get more and more used to letting them happen and just keep expressing them, this usually results in their growth, not their reduction. So, I feel that the more you adopt a cautious attitude and actively try to reduce the level of their force, the better it is.\u201d \u201cSo, if you feel that expressing or releasing our anger isn\u2019t the answer, then what is?\u201d I inquired."}, {"text": " \u201cNow, first of all, feelings of anger and hatred arise from a mind that is troubled by dissatisfaction and discontent. So you can prepare ahead of time by constantly working toward building inner contentment and cultivating kindness and compassion. This brings about a certain calmness of mind that can help prevent  \fanger from arising in the first place."}, {"text": " And then when a situation does arise that makes you angry, you should directly confront your anger and analyze it. Investigate what factors have given rise to that particular instance of anger or hatred. Then, analyze further, seeing whether it is an appropriate response and especially whether it is constructive or destructive."}, {"text": " And you make an effort to exert a certain inner discipline and restraint, actively combating it by applying the antidotes: counteracting these negative emotions with thoughts of patience and tolerance.\u201d The Dalai Lama paused, then with his customary pragmatism, added, \u201cOf course, in working towards overcoming anger and hatred, at the initial stage you may still experience these negative emotions."}, {"text": " But there are different levels; if it\u2019s a mild degree of anger, then at that moment  \fyou can attempt to directly confront it and combat it. However, if it\u2019s a very strong negative emotion that develops, then, at that moment, it might be very difficult to challenge or to face it. If that is the case, then at that moment it may be best to simply try to forget about it."}, {"text": " Think of something else. Once your mind is a little bit calmed down, then you can analyze; you can reason.\u201d In other words, I reflected, he was saying, \u201cTake a time out.\u201d He went on. \u201cIn seeking to eliminate anger and hatred, the intentional cultivation of patience and tolerance is indispensable."}, {"text": " You could conceive of the value and importance of patience and tolerance in these terms: Insofar as the destructive effects of angry and hateful thoughts are concerned, you cannot get protection from these from wealth. Even if you are a millionaire,  \fyou are still subject to the destructive effects of anger and hatred."}, {"text": " Nor can education alone give you a guarantee that you will be protected from these effects. Similarly, the law cannot give you such guarantees or protection. Even nuclear weapons, no matter how sophisticated the defense system may be, cannot give you the protection or defense from these effects ..."}, {"text": "\u201d The Dalai Lama paused to gather momentum, then concluded in a clear, firm voice, \u201cThe only factor that can give you refuge or protection from the destructive effects of anger and hatred is your practice of tolerance and patience.\u201d  \fOnce again, the Dalai Lama\u2019s traditional wisdom is completely consistent with the scientific data."}, {"text": " Dr. Dolf Zillmann at the University of Alabama has conducted experiments demonstrating that angry thoughts tend to create a state of physiological arousal that makes us even more prone to anger. Anger builds on anger, and as our state of arousal increases, we are more easily triggered by anger-provoking environmental stimuli."}, {"text": " If left unchecked, anger tends to escalate. So, how do we go about diffusing our anger? As the Dalai Lama suggests, giving vent to anger and rage has very limited benefits. The therapeutic expression of anger as a means of catharsis seems to have originated from Freud\u2019s theories of emotion, which he saw as operating on a hydraulic model: when pressure builds, it must be  \freleased."}, {"text": " The idea of getting rid of our anger by giving vent to it has some dramatic appeal and in a way might even sound like fun, but the problem is that this method simply does not work. Many studies over the past four decades have consistently shown that the verbal and physical expression of our anger does nothing to dispel it and just makes things worse."}, {"text": " Dr. Aaron Siegman, a psychologist and anger researcher at the University of Maryland, believes, for instance, that it is just this kind of repeated expression of anger and rage that triggers the internal arousal systems and biochemical responses that are most likely to cause damage to our arteries."}, {"text": " While giving vent to our anger clearly isn\u2019t the answer, neither is ignoring our anger or pretending it isn\u2019t there. As we discussed in Part III, avoidance of our problems does not make  \fthem go away. So, what\u2019s the best approach? Interestingly, the consensus among modern anger researchers such as Dr."}, {"text": " Zillmann and Dr. Williams, is that methods similar to the Dalai Lama\u2019s appear to be most effective. Since general stress lowers the threshold for what may trigger anger, the first step is preventative: cultivating an inner contentment and calmer state of mind, as recommended by the Dalai Lama, can definitely help."}, {"text": " And when anger does occur, research has shown that actively challenging, logically analyzing, and reappraising the thoughts that trigger the anger can help dissipate it. There is also experimental evidence suggesting that the techniques that we discussed earlier, such as shifting perspective or looking at different angles of a situation, can also be very effective."}, {"text": " Of course, these things are often easier to do at  \flower or moderate levels of anger, so practicing early intervention before thoughts of anger and hatred escalate can be an important factor.  Because of their vast importance in overcoming anger and hatred, the Dalai Lama spoke in some detail on the meaning and value of patience and tolerance."}, {"text": " \u201cIn our day-to-day life experiences, tolerance and patience have great benefits. For instance, developing them will allow us to sustain and maintain our presence of mind. So if an individual possesses this capacity of tolerance and patience, then, even in spite of living in a very tense environment, which is very frantic and stressful,  \fso long as the person has tolerance and patience, the person\u2019s calmness and peace of mind will not be disturbed."}, {"text": " \u201cAnother benefit of responding to difficult situations with patience rather than giving in to anger is that you protect yourself from potential undesirable consequences that might come about if you reacted with anger. If you respond to situations with anger and hatred, not only does it not protect you from the injury or harm that has already been done to you\u2014the injury and harm has already taken place\u2014but on top of that, you create an additional cause for your own suffering in the future."}, {"text": " However, if you respond to an injury with patience and tolerance, then although you may face temporary discomfort and hurt, you will still avoid the potentially dangerous long-term consequences. By sacrificing small things, by  \fputting up with small problems or hardships, you will be able to forgo experiences or sufferings that can be much more enormous in the future."}, {"text": " To illustrate, if a convicted prisoner could save his life by sacrificing his arm as a punishment, wouldn\u2019t that person feel grateful for the opportunity? By putting up with that pain and suffering of having an arm cut off, the person would be saving himself or herself from death, which is a greater suffering."}, {"text": "\u201d \u201cTo the Western mind,\u201d I observed, \u201cpatience and tolerance are certainly considered virtues, but when you are directly beset by others, when someone is actively harming you, responding with \u2018patience and tolerance\u2019 seems to have a flavor of weakness, of passivity.\u201d Shaking his head in disagreement, the Dalai Lama said, \u201cSince patience or tolerance comes  \ffrom an ability to remain firm and steadfast and not be overwhelmed by the adverse situations or conditions that one faces, one should not see tolerance or patience as a sign of weakness, or giving in, but rather as a sign of strength, coming from a deep ability to remain firm."}, {"text": " Responding to a trying situation with patience and tolerance rather than reacting with anger and hatred involves active restraint, which comes from a strong, self-disciplined mind. \u201cOf course, in discussing the concept of patience, as in most other things, there can be positive and negative kinds of patience."}, {"text": " Impatience isn\u2019t always bad. For instance, it can help you take action to get things done. Even in your daily chores, like cleaning your room, if you have too much patience, you might move too slowly and get little done. Or, impatience to gain  \fworld peace\u2014that certainly can be positive. But in situations that are difficult and challenging, patience helps maintain your willpower and can sustain you."}, {"text": "\u201d Becoming increasingly animated as he moved more deeply into his investigation of the meaning of patience, the Dalai Lama added, \u201cI think that there is a very close connection between humility and patience. Humility involves having the capacity to take a more confrontational stance, having the capacity to retaliate if you wish, yet deliberately deciding not to do so."}, {"text": " That is what I would call genuine humility. I think that true tolerance or patience has a component or element of self-discipline and restraint\u2014the realization that you could have acted otherwise, you could have adopted a more aggressive approach, but decided not to do so. On the other  \fhand, being forced to adopt a certain passive response out of a feeling of helplessness or incapacitation\u2014that I wouldn\u2019t call genuine humility."}, {"text": " That may be a kind of meekness, but it isn\u2019t genuine tolerance. \u201cNow when we talk about how we should develop tolerance towards those who harm us, we should not misunderstand this to mean that we should just meekly accept whatever is done against us.\u201d The Dalai Lama paused, then laughed. \u201cRather, if necessary, the best, the wisest course, might be to simply run away\u2014run miles away!\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t always avoid being harmed by running away ."}, {"text": "..\u201d \u201cYes, that\u2019s true,\u201d he replied. \u201cSometimes, you may encounter situations that require strong countermeasures. I believe, however, that you  \fcan take a strong stand and even take strong countermeasures out of a feeling of compassion, or a sense of concern for the other, rather than out of anger."}, {"text": " One of the reasons why there is a need to adopt a very strong countermeasure against someone is that if you let it pass\u2014 whatever the harm or the crime that is being perpetrated against you\u2014then there is a danger of that person\u2019s habituating in a very negative way, which, in reality, will cause that individual\u2019s own downfall and is very destructive in the long run for the individual himself or herself."}, {"text": " Therefore a strong countermeasure is necessary, but with this thought in mind, you can do it out of compassion and concern for that individual. For example, so far as our own dealings with China are concerned, even if there is a likelihood of some feeling of hatred arising, we deliberately  \fcheck ourselves and try to reduce that, we try to consciously develop a feeling of compassion towards the Chinese."}, {"text": " And I think that countermeasures can ultimately be more effective without feelings of anger and hatred. \u201cNow, we\u2019ve explored methods of developing patience and tolerance and letting go of anger and hatred, methods such as using reasoning to analyze the situation, adopting a wider perspective, and looking at other angles of a situation."}, {"text": " An end result, or a product of patience and tolerance, is forgiveness. When you are truly patient and tolerant, then forgiveness comes naturally. \u201cAlthough you may have experienced many negative events in the past, with the development of patience and tolerance it is possible to let go of your sense of anger and resentment."}, {"text": " If you  \fanalyze the situation, you\u2019ll realize that the past is past, so there is no use continuing to feel anger and hatred, which do not change the situation but just cause a disturbance within your mind and cause your continued unhappiness. Of course, you may still remember the events. Forgetting and forgiving are two different things."}, {"text": " There\u2019s nothing wrong with simply remembering those negative events; if you have a sharp mind, you\u2019ll always remember,\u201d he laughed. \u201cI think the Buddha remembered everything. But with the development of patience and tolerance, it\u2019s possible to let go of the negative feelings associated with the events."}, {"text": "\u201d  \fMEDITATIONS ON ANGER  In many of these discussions, the Dalai Lama\u2019s primary method of overcoming anger and hatred involved the use of reasoning and analysis to investigate the causes of anger, to combat these harmful mental states through understanding. In a sense, this approach can be seen as using logic to neutralize anger and hatred and to cultivate the antidotes of patience and tolerance."}, {"text": " But that wasn\u2019t his only technique. In his public talks he supplemented his discussion by presenting instruction on these two simple yet effective meditations to help overcome anger.  \fMeditation on Anger: Exercise 1  \u201cLet us imagine a scenario in which someone who you know very well, someone who is close or dear to you, is in a situation in which he or she loses his or her temper."}, {"text": " You can imagine this occurring either in a very acrimonious relationship or in a situation in which something personally upsetting is happening. The person is so angry that he or she has lost all his or her mental composure, creating very negative vibrations, even going to the extent of beating himself or herself up or breaking things."}, {"text": " \u201cThen, reflect upon the immediate effects of the person\u2019s rage. You\u2019ll see a physical transformation happening to that person. This  \fperson whom you feel close to, whom you like, the very sight of whom gave you pleasure in the past, now turns into this ugly person, even physically speaking. The reason why I think you should visualize this happening to someone else is because it is easier to see the faults of others than to see your own faults."}, {"text": " So, using your imagination, do this meditation and visualization for a few minutes. \u201cAt the end of that visualization, analyze the situation and relate the circumstances to your own experience. See that you yourself have been in this state many times. Resolve that \u2018I shall never let myself fall under the sway of such intense anger and hatred, because if I do that, I will be in the same position."}, {"text": " I will also suffer all these consequences, lose my peace of mind, lose my composure, assume this ugly physical  \fappearance,\u2019 and so on.

So for a few minutes, three or four minutes perhaps, judge, and experiment. And then at the end of your investigation, if you discover that \u2018Yes, it is of no use to allow that irritation to develop.

So that\u2019s the meditation.\u201d The Dalai Lama paused for a moment, then looking around the room of sincere students preparing to practice this meditation, he laughed, and added, \u201cI think if I had the cognitive faculty, ability, or the clear awareness to be able to read other people\u2019s minds, then there would be a great spectacle here!\u201d  \fThere was a ripple of laughter in the audience, which quickly died down as his listeners started the meditation, beginning the serious business of doing battle with their anger."}, {"text": "  \fChapter 14  DEALING WITH ANXIETY AND BUILDING SELF-ESTEEM  It is estimated that in the course of a lifetime at least one in four Americans will suffer from a debilitating degree of anxiety or worry severe  \fenough to meet the criteria for the medical diagnosis of an anxiety disorder. But even those who never suffer from a pathological or disabling state of anxiety will, at one time or another, experience excessive levels of worry and anxiety that serve no useful purpose and do nothing but undermine their happiness and interfere with their ability to accomplish their goals."}, {"text": " The human brain is equipped with an elaborate system designed to register the emotions of fear and worry. This system serves an important function\u2014it mobilizes us to respond to danger by setting in motion a complex sequence of biochemical and physiological events. The adaptive side of worry is that it allows us to anticipate danger and take preventative action."}, {"text": " So, some types of fears and a certain amount of worry can be healthy.  \fHowever, feelings of fear and anxiety can persist and even escalate in the absence of an authentic threat, and when these emotions grow out of proportion to any real danger they become maladaptive. Excessive anxiety and worry can, like anger and hatred, have devastating effects on the mind and body, becoming the source of much emotional suffering and even physical illness."}, {"text": " On a mental level, chronic anxiety can impair judgment, increase irritability, and hinder one\u2019s overall effectiveness. It can also lead to physical problems including depressed immune function, heart disease, gastrointestinal disorders, fatigue, and muscle tension and pain. Anxiety disorders, for instance, have even been shown to cause stunted growth in adolescent girls."}, {"text": " In seeking strategies to deal with anxiety, we must first recognize, as the Dalai Lama will point  \fout, that there may be many factors contributing to the experience of anxiety. In some cases, there may be a strong biological component. Some people seem to have a certain neurological vulnerability to experiencing states of worry and anxiety."}, {"text": " Scientists have recently discovered a gene that is linked to people who are prone to anxiety and negative thinking. Not all cases of toxic worry are genetic in origin, however, and there is little doubt that learning and conditioning play a major role in its etiology. But, regardless of whether our anxiety is predominantly physical or psychological in origin, the good news is that there is something we can do about it."}, {"text": " In the most severe cases of anxiety, medication can be a useful part of the treatment regimen. But most of us who are troubled by nagging day-to-day worries and anxiety will not  \fneed pharmacological intervention. Experts in the field of anxiety management generally feel that a multidimensional approach is best."}, {"text": " This would include first ruling out an underlying medical condition as the cause of our anxiety. Working on improving our physical health through proper diet and exercise can also be helpful. And, as the Dalai Lama has emphasized, cultivating compassion and deepening our connection with others can promote good mental hygiene and help combat anxiety states."}, {"text": " In searching for practical strategies to overcome anxiety, however, there is one technique that stands out as particularly effective: cognitive intervention. This is one of the main methods used by the Dalai Lama to overcome daily worries and anxiety. Applying the same procedure used with anger and hatred, this  \ftechnique involves actively challenging the anxiety-generating thoughts and replacing them with well-reasoned positive thoughts and attitudes."}, {"text": "  Because of the pervasiveness of anxiety in our culture, I was eager to bring up the subject with the Dalai Lama and learn how he deals with it. His schedule was particularly busy that day, and I could feel my own anxiety level rising as, moments before our interview, I was informed by his secretary that we would have to cut our conversation short."}, {"text": " Feeling pressed for time and worrying that we wouldn\u2019t be able to address all the topics I wanted to discuss, I sat down quickly  \fand began, reverting to my intermittent tendency to try to elicit simplistic answers from him. \u201cYou know, fear and anxiety can be a major obstacle to achieving our goals, whether they are external goals or inner growth."}, {"text": " In psychiatry we have various methods of dealing with these things, but I\u2019m curious, from your standpoint, what\u2019s the best way to overcome fear and anxiety?\u201d Resisting my invitation to oversimplify the matter, the Dalai Lama answered with his characteristically thorough approach. \u201cIn dealing with fear, I think that we first need to recognize that there are many different types of fear."}, {"text": " Some kinds of fear are very genuine, based on valid reasons, fear of violence or fear of bloodshed, for example. We can see that these things are very bad. Then there\u2019s fear about the  \flong-term negative consequences of our negative actions, fear of suffering, fear of our negative emotions such as hatred."}, {"text": " I think these are the right kinds of fears; having these kinds of fears bring us onto the right path, bring us closer to becoming a warmhearted person.\u201d He stopped to reflect, then mused, \u201cAlthough in a sense these are kinds of fears, I think perhaps that there may be some difference between fearing these things and the mind\u2019s seeing the destructive nature of these things ."}, {"text": "..\u201d He ceased speaking again for several moments, and appeared to be deliberating, while I stole furtive glances at my watch. Clearly he didn\u2019t feel the same time crunch that I did. Finally, he continued speaking in a leisurely manner. \u201cOn the other hand, some kinds of fears are  \four own mental creations."}, {"text": " These fears may be based mainly on mental projection. For example, there are very childish fears,\u201d he laughed, \u201clike when we were young and passed through a dark place, especially some of the dark rooms in the Potala,5 and became afraid\u2014that was based completely on mental projection. Or, when I was young, the sweepers and people looking after me always warned me that there was an owl that caught young children and consumed them!\u201d the Dalai Lama laughed even harder."}, {"text": " \u201cAnd I really believed them!\u201d \u201cThere are other types of fear based on mental projection,\u201d he continued. \u201cFor example, if you have negative feelings, because of your own mental situation, you may project those feelings onto another, who then appears as someone negative and hostile. And as a result,  \fyou feel fear."}, {"text": " That kind of fear, I think, is related to hatred and comes about as a sort of mental creation. So, in dealing with fear, you need to first use your faculty of reasoning and try to discover whether there is a valid basis for your fear or not.\u201d I asked, \u201cWell, rather than an intense or focused fear of a specific individual or situation, many of us are plagued by more of an ongoing diffuse worry about a variety of day-to-day problems."}, {"text": " Do you have any suggestions about how to handle that?\u201d Nodding his head, he replied, \u201cOne of the approaches that I personally find useful to reduce that kind of worry is to cultivate the thought: If the situation or problem is such that it can be remedied, then there is no need to worry about it."}, {"text": " In other words, if there is a solution or  \fa way out of the difficulty, then one needn\u2019t be overwhelmed by it. The appropriate action is to seek its solution. It is more sensible to spend the energy focusing on the solution rather than worrying about the problem. Alternatively, if there is no way out, no solution, no Possibility of resolution, then there is also no point in being worried about it, because you can\u2019t do anything about it anyway."}, {"text": " In that case, the sooner you accept this fact, the easier it will be on you. This formula, of course, implies directly confronting the problem. Otherwise you won\u2019t be able to find out whether or not there is a resolution to the problem.\u201c \u201cWhat if thinking about that doesn\u2019t help alleviate your anxiety?\u201d \u201cWell, you may need to reflect on these thoughts a bit more and reinforce these ideas."}, {"text": "  \fRemind yourself of it repeatedly. Anyway, I think that this approach can help reduce anxiety and worry, but that doesn\u2019t mean it always will work. If you are dealing with ongoing anxiety, I think you need to look at the specific situation. There are different types of anxieties and different causes."}, {"text": " For example, some types of anxiety or nervousness could have some biological causes; for instance, some people tend to get sweaty palms, which according to the Tibetan medical system could indicate an imbalance of subtle energy levels. Some types of anxiety, just like some types of depression for instance, may have biological roots, and for these medical treatment may be useful."}, {"text": " So in order to deal with the anxiety effectively, you need to look at the kind it is and the cause. \u201cSo, just like fear, there can be different types  \fof anxiety. For example, one type of anxiety, which I think may be common, could involve fear of appearing foolish in front of others or fear that others might think badly of you ."}, {"text": "..\u201d \u201cHave you ever experienced that kind of anxiety or nervousness?\u201d I interrupted. The Dalai Lama broke into a robust laugh, and without hesitation he responded, \u201cOh yes!\u201d \u201cCan you give an example?\u201d He thought for a moment, then said, \u201cNow, for instance, in 1954 in China, on the first day of meeting with Chairman Mao Zedong, and also another occasion in meeting with Chou En-lai."}, {"text": " In those days I wasn\u2019t fully aware of the proper protocol and convention. The usual procedure for a meeting was to start with some casual talk and then proceed to the discussion of business. But on that occasion I was so nervous that the  \fmoment I sat down, I just jumped right into business!\u201d The Dalai Lama laughed at the memory."}, {"text": " \u201cI remember that afterwards my translator, a Tibetan communist who was very reliable and my great, great friend, looked at me and started laughing and teasing me about it. \u201cI think that even these days, just before a public talk or teachings are about to start, I always feel a little bit of anxiety, so some of my attendants usually say, \u2018If that\u2019s the case, then why did you accept the invitation to give teachings in the first place?\u2019 \u201d He laughed again."}, {"text": " \u201cSo how do you personally deal with that kind of anxiety?\u201d I asked. With a querulous and unaffected tone in his voice he said quietly, \u201cI don\u2019t know ...\u201d He paused, and we sat in silence for a long time, as once again he seemed to carefully consider and  \freflect. At last he said, \u201cI think having proper motivation and honesty are the keys to overcoming those kinds of fear and anxiety."}, {"text": " So, if I am anxious before giving a talk, I\u2019ll remind myself that the main reason, the aim of giving the lecture, is to be of at least some benefit to the people, not for showing off my knowledge. So, those points which I know, I\u2019ll explain. Those points which I do not understand properly\u2014then it doesn\u2019t matter; I just say, \u2018For me, this is difficult."}, {"text": "\u2019 There\u2019s no reason to hide or to pretend. From that standpoint, with that motivation, I don\u2019t have to worry about appearing foolish or care about what others think of me. So, I\u2019ve found that sincere motivation acts as an antidote to reduce fear and anxiety.\u201d \u201cWell, sometimes the anxiety involves more than just appearing foolish in front of others."}, {"text": " It\u2019s  \fmore of a fear of failure, a feeling of being incompetent ...\u201d I reflected for a moment, considering how much personal information to reveal. The Dalai Lama listened intently, silently nodding as I spoke. I\u2019m not sure what it was. Maybe it was his attitude of sympathetic understanding, but before I knew it, I had shifted from discussing broad general issues to soliciting his advice about dealing with my own fears and anxieties."}, {"text": " \u201cI don\u2019t know ... sometimes with my patients for instance ... some are very difficult to treat\u2014 cases in which it isn\u2019t a matter of making a clearcut diagnosis like depression or some other illness that is easily remedied. There are some patients with severe personality disorders, for instance, who don\u2019t respond to medication and  \fhave failed to make much progress in psychotherapy despite my best efforts."}, {"text": " Sometimes I just don\u2019t know what to do with these people, how to help them. I can\u2019t seem to get a grasp on what\u2019s going on with them. And it makes me feel immobilized, sort of helpless,\u201d I complained. \u201cIt makes me feel incompetent, and that really creates a certain kind of fear, of anxiety."}, {"text": "\u201d He listened solemnly, then asked in a kindly voice, \u201cWould you say that you\u2019re able to help 70 percent of your patients?\u201d \u201cAt least that,\u201d I replied. Patting my hand gently, he said, \u201cThen I think that there\u2019s no problem here. If you were able to help only 30 percent of your patients, then I might suggest that you consider another profession."}, {"text": " But I think you\u2019re doing fine. In my  \fcase people also come to me for help. Many are looking for miracles, for miraculous cures, and so on, and of course I can\u2019t help everybody. But I think the main thing is motivation\u2014to have a sincere motivation to help. Then you just do the best you can, and you don\u2019t have to worry about it."}, {"text": " \u201cSo, in my case also there are of course some situations that are tremendously delicate or serious, and such a heavy responsibility. I think the worst is when people place too much trust or belief in me, in circumstances in which some things are beyond my capability. In such cases, sometimes anxiety, of course, develops."}, {"text": " Here, once again, we return to the importance of motivation. Then, I try to remind myself as far as my own motivation is concerned, I am sincere, and I tried my best. With a sincere motivation,  \fone of compassion, even if I made a mistake or failed, there is no cause for regret. For my part I did my best."}, {"text": " Then, you see, if I failed, it was because the situation was beyond my best efforts. So that sincere motivation removes fear and gives you self-confidence. On the other hand, if your underlying motivation is to cheat someone, then if you fail, you really become nervous. But if you cultivate a compassionate motivation, if you fail, then there\u2019s no regret."}, {"text": " \u201cSo, again and again, I think that proper motivation can be a sort of protector, shielding you against these feelings of fear and anxiety. Motivation is so important. In fact all human action can be seen in terms of movement, and the mover behind all actions is one\u2019s motivation. If you develop a pure and sincere motivation, if you are motivated by a wish to help on the basis of  \fkindness, compassion, and respect, then you can carry on any kind of work, in any field, and function more effectively with less fear or worry, not being afraid of what others think or whether you ultimately will be successful in reaching your goal."}, {"text": " Even if you fail to achieve your goal, you can feel good about having made the effort. But with a bad motivation, people can praise you or you can achieve goals, but you still will not be happy.\u201d  In discussing the antidotes to anxiety, the Dalai Lama offers two remedies, each working on a different level."}, {"text": " The first involves actively combating chronic rumination and worry by  \fapplying a counteractive thought: reminding oneself, If there is a solution to the problem, there is no need to worry. If there is no solution, there is no sense in worrying either. The second antidote is a more broadspectrum remedy."}, {"text": " It involves the transformation of one\u2019s underlying motivation. There is an interesting contrast between the Dalai Lama\u2019s approach to human motivation and that of Western science and psychology. As we previously discussed, researchers who have studied human motivation have investigated normal human motives, looking at both instinctual and learned needs and drives."}, {"text": " At this level, the Dalai Lama has focused on developing and using learned drives to enhance one\u2019s \u201centhusiasm and determination.\u201d In some respects, this is similar to the view of many conventional Western  \f\u201cmotivation experts,\u201d who also seek to boost one\u2019s enthusiasm and determination to accomplish goals."}, {"text": " But the difference is that the Dalai Lama seeks to build determination and enthusiasm to engage in more wholesome behaviors and eliminate negative mental traits, rather than emphasizing the achievement of worldly success, money, or power. And perhaps the most striking difference is that whereas the \u201cmotivational speakers\u201d are busy fanning the flames of already existing motives for worldly success, and the Western theorists are preoccupied with categorizing standard human motives, the Dalai Lama\u2019s primary interest in human motivation lies in resbaping and changing one\u2019s underlying motivation to one of compassion and kindness."}, {"text": " In the Dalai Lama\u2019s system of training the  \fmind and achieving happiness, the closer one gets to being motivated by altruism, the more fearless one becomes in the face of even extremely anxiety-provoking circumstances. But the same principle can be applied in smaller ways, even when one\u2019s motivation is less than completely altruistic."}, {"text": " Standing back and simply making sure that you mean no harm and that your motivation is sincere can help reduce anxiety in ordinary daily situations. Not long after the above conversation with the Dalai Lama, I had lunch with a group of people that included one young man whom I had not met before, a college student at a local university."}, {"text": " During lunch, someone asked how my series of discussions with the Dalai Lama were going, and I recounted the conversation about overcoming anxiety. After quietly listening to me  \fdescribe the idea of \u201csincere motivation as an antidote to anxiety,\u201d the student confided that he had always been painfully shy and very anxious in social situations."}, {"text": " In thinking about how he might apply this technique in overcoming his own anxiety, the student muttered, \u201cWell, all that\u2019s pretty interesting. But I guess the hard part is always having this lofty motivation of kindness and compassion.\u201d \u201cI suppose that\u2019s true,\u201d I had to admit. The general conversation turned to other subjects, and we finished our lunch."}, {"text": " I happened to run into the same college student the following week at the same restaurant. Approaching me in a cheerful manner, he said, \u201cYou remember we were talking about motivation and anxiety the other day? Well, I tried it out and it really works! There\u2019s this girl  \fwho works at a department store in the mall whom I\u2019ve seen a lot of times; I\u2019ve always wanted to ask her out, but I don\u2019t know her and I\u2019ve always felt too shy and anxious, so I\u2019ve never even talked to her."}, {"text": " Well, the other day I went in again, but this time I started thinking about my motivation for asking her out. My motivation, of course, is that I\u2019d like to date her. But behind that is just the wish that I could find someone whom I can love and who will love me. When I thought about it, I realized that there is nothing wrong with that, that my motivation was sincere; I didn\u2019t wish any harm to her or myself, but only good things."}, {"text": " Just keeping that in mind, and reminding myself of it a few times, seemed to help somehow; it gave me the courage to strike up a conversation with her. My heart was still pounding, but I feel great that at least I was able  \fto get up the nerve to speak with her.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that,\u201d I said."}, {"text": " \u201cWhat happened?\u201d \u201cWell, as it turns out, she already has a steady boyfriend. I was a bit disappointed, but it\u2019s okay. It just felt good that I was able to overcome my shyness. And it made me realize that if I make sure that there\u2019s nothing wrong with my motivation and keep that in mind, it could help the next time I\u2019m in the same situation."}, {"text": "\u201d  \fHONESTY AS AN ANTIDOTE TO LOW SELF-ESTEEM OR INFLATED SELF-CONFIDENCE  A healthy sense of self-confidence is a critical factor in achieving our goals.

Insight-oriented psychotherapists focus on helping the patients gain an understanding of the dysfunctional patterns in their early relationships that were the cause of the problem and provide appropriate feedback and a therapeutic environment where the patients can gradually restructure and repair their negative self-image."}, {"text": " On the other hand, the Dalai Lama focuses on \u201cpulling out the arrow\u201d rather than spending time wondering who shot it. Instead of wondering why people have low self-esteem or inflated selfconfidence, he presents a method of directly combating these negative states of mind.  \fIn recent decades, the nature of \u201cthe self\u201d was one of the most researched topics in the field of psychology."}, {"text": " In the \u201cme decade\u201d of the 1980s, for instance, thousands of articles appeared each year, exploring issues related to self-esteem and self-confidence.

And then if something is within your scope and you can\u2019t do it, you begin to feel, \u2018Oh, you know, maybe I\u2019m not good enough or competent enough or up to it\u2019 or something along those lines."}, {"text": " However, for me to realize that I cannot perform miracles\u2014that does not lead to loss of confidence, because I never believed myself to have that capacity in the first place. I don\u2019t expect myself to be able to perform functions like the fully enlightened Buddhas\u2014to be able to know everything, perceive everything,  \for do the right thing at any and all times."}, {"text": " So when people come to me and ask me to heal them or perform a miracle or something like that, instead of making me feel a lack of confidence, it just makes me feel quite awkward. \u201cI think that, generally, being honest with oneself and others about what you are or are not capable of doing can counteract that feeling of lack of self-confidence."}, {"text": " \u201cBut then, now for example, in handling the situation with China, sometimes I feel a lack of self-confidence. But usually I consult about such a situation with officials and in some cases nonofficials. I ask my friends their opinion and then discuss the matter. Since many of the decisions are taken on the basis of discussions with various people and not just taken rashly, any decision that is taken then makes me feel quite  \fconfident and there\u2019s no sense of regret for having taken that course."}, {"text": "\u201d  Fearless and honest self-appraisal can be a powerful weapon against self-doubt and low selfconfidence. The Dalai Lama\u2019s belief that this kind of honesty can act as an antidote to these negative states of mind has in fact been confirmed by a number of recent studies that clearly show that those who have a realistic and accurate view of themselves tend to like themselves better and have more confidence than those with poor or inaccurate self-knowledge."}, {"text": " Over the years, I\u2019ve often witnessed the Dalai Lama\u2019s illustrating how self-confidence comes  \ffrom being honest and straightforward about one\u2019s abilities. It came as quite a surprise to me when I first heard him say in front of a large audience simply \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d in response to a question."}, {"text": " Unlike what I was used to with academic lecturers or those who set themselves up as authorities, he admitted his lack of knowledge without embarrassment, qualifying statements, or attempting to appear that he knew something by skirting the issue. In fact, he seemed to take a certain delight when confronted with a difficult question for which he had no answer and often joked about it."}, {"text": " For example, one afternoon in Tucson, he had been commenting on one verse of Shantideva\u2019s Guide to the Bodhisattva\u2019s Way of Life that was particularly complex in its logic. He struggled with it for a while, got mixed up, then burst out  \flaughing, saying: \u201cI\u2019m confused! I think it\u2019s better just to leave it."}, {"text": " Now, in the next verse ...\u201d In response to appreciative laughter from the audience, he laughed even harder, commenting, \u201cThere is a particular expression for this approach. The expression is it\u2019s like an old person eating\u2014an old person with very poor teeth. The soft things you eat; the hard things, you just leave."}, {"text": "\u201d Still laughing, he said, \u201cSo we\u2019ll leave it at that for today.\u201d He never wavered in that moment from his own supreme confidence.  \fREFLECTING ON OUR POTENTIAL AS AN ANTIDOTE TO SELF-HATRED  On one trip to India in 1991, two years before the Dalai Lama\u2019s visit to Arizona, I briefly met with him at his home in Dharamsala."}, {"text": " That week he had been meeting daily with a distinguished group of Western scientists, physicians, psychologists, and meditation teachers, in an attempt to explore the mind-body connection and understand the relationship between emotional experience and physical health. I met with the Dalai Lama late one afternoon, afterone of his sessions with the scientists."}, {"text": " Toward the end of  \four interview, the Dalai Lama asked, \u201cYou know this week I\u2019ve been meeting with these scientists?\u201d \u201cYes ...\u201d \u201cSomething came up this week which I found very surprising. This concept of \u2018self-hatred.\u2019 You are familiar with that concept?\u201d \u201cDefinitely. A fair proportion of my patients suffer from it."}, {"text": "\u201d \u201cWhen these people were speaking about it, at first I wasn\u2019t certain if I was understanding the concept correctly,\u201d he laughed. \u201cI thought, \u2018Of course we love ourselves! How can a person hate himself or herself?\u2019 Although I thought that I had some understanding about how the mind works, this idea of hating oneself was completely new to me."}, {"text": " The reason why I found it quite unbelievable is that practicing Buddhists work  \fvery hard trying to overcome our self-centered attitude, our selfish thoughts and motives. From this viewpoint I think we love and cherish ourselves too much. So to think of the possibility of someone not cherishing oneself, and even hating oneself, was quite, quite unbelievable."}, {"text": " As a psychiatrist, can you explain this concept for me, how it occurs?\u201d I briefly described for him the psychological view of how self-hatred arises. I explained how our self-image is shaped by our parents and upbringing, how we pick up implicit messages about ourselves from them as we grow and develop, and I outlined the specific conditions that create a negative self-image."}, {"text": " I went on to detail the factors that exacerbate self-hatred, such as when our behavior fails to live up to our idealized self-image, and described some of the  \fways that self-hatred can be cultur ally reinforced, particularly in some women and minorities. While I was discussing these things, the Dalai Lama continued to nod thoughtfully with a quizzical expression on his face, as if he were still having some difficulty grasping this strange concept."}, {"text": "  Groucho Marx once quipped, \u201cI\u2019d never join any club that would have me for a member.\u201d Broadening this kind of negative self-view into an observation about human nature, Mark Twain said, \u201cNo man, deep down in the privacy of his  \fown heart, has any considerable respect for himself.\u201d And taking this pessimistic view of humanity and incorporating it into his psychological theories, the humanistic psychologist Carl Rogers once claimed, \u201cMost people despise themselves, regard themselves as worthless and unlovable."}, {"text": "\u201d There is a popular notion in our society, shared by most contemporary psychotherapists, that self-hatred is rampant within Western culture. While it certainly exists, fortunately it may not be as widespread as many believe. It certainly is a common problem among those who seek psychotherapy, but sometimes psychotherapists in clinical practice have a skewed view, a tendency to base their general view of human nature on those few individuals who walk into their offices."}, {"text": " Most of the data  \fbased on experimental evidence, however, have established the fact that often people tend to (or at least want to) see themselves in a favorable light, rating themselves as \u201cbetter than average\u201d in almost any survey asking about subjective and socially desirable qualities. So, while self-hatred may not be as universal as commonly thought, it can still be a tremendous obstacle for many people."}, {"text": " I was as surprised by the Dalai Lama\u2019s reaction as he was by the concept of self-hatred. His initial response alone can be very revealing and healing. There are two points related to his remarkable reaction that warrant examination. The first point is simply that he was unfamiliar with the existence of self-hatred."}, {"text": " The underlying assumption that self-hatred is a widespread human problem leads to an impressionistic sense  \fthat it is a deeply ingrained feature of the human psyche. But the fact that it is virtually unheard of within entire cultures, in this case the Tibetan culture, strongly reminds us that this troubling mental state, like all of the other negative mental states that we have discussed, is not an intrinsic part of the human mind."}, {"text": " It is not something that we are born with, irrevocably saddled with, nor is it an indelible characteristic of our nature. It can be removed. This realization alone can serve to weaken its power, give us hope, and increase our commitment to eliminate it. The second point related to the Dalai Lama\u2019s initial reaction was his response, \u201cHate oneself? Of course, we love ourselves!\u201d For those of us who suffer from self-hatred or know someone who does, this response may seem incredibly naive at first glance."}, {"text": " But on closer investigation,  \fthere may be a penetrating truth to his response. Love is difficult to define, and there may be different definitions. But one definition of love, and perhaps the most pure and exalted kind of love, is an utter, absolute, and unqualified wish for the happiness of another individual."}, {"text": " It is a heartfelt wish for the other\u2019s happiness regardless of whether he does something to injure us or even whether we like him. Now, deep in our hearts, there\u2019s no question that every one of us wants to be happy. So, if our definition of love is based on a genuine wish for someone\u2019s happiness, then each of us does in fact love himself or herself\u2014every one of us sincerely wishes for his or her own happiness."}, {"text": " In my clinical practice I\u2019ve sometimes encountered the most extreme cases of self-hatred, to the point where the person experiences recurrent thoughts  \fof suicide. But even in these most extreme cases, the thought of death is ultimately based on the individual\u2019s wish (distorted and misguided though it may be) to release her- or himself from suffering, not cause it."}, {"text": " So perhaps the Dalai Lama was not far off the mark in his belief that all of us have an underlying self-love, and this idea suggests a powerful antidote to self-hatred: we can directly counteract thoughts of self-contempt by reminding ourselves that no matter how much we may dislike some of our characteristics, underneath it all we wish ourselves to be happy, and that is a profound kind of love."}, {"text": "  \fOn a subsequent visit to Dharamsala, I returned to the subject of self-hatred with the Dalai Lama. By then he had familiarized himself with the concept and had begun developing methods for combating it. \u201cFrom the Buddhist point of view,\u201d he explained, \u201cbeing in a depressed state, in a state of discouragement, is seen as a kind of extreme that can clearly be an obstacle to taking the steps necessary to accomplish one\u2019s goals."}, {"text": " A state of self-hatred is even far more extreme than simply being discouraged, and this can be very, very dangerous. For those engaged in Buddhist practice, the antidote to self-hatred would be to reflect upon the fact that all beings, including oneself, have Buddha Nature\u2014the seed or potential for perfection, full Enlightenment\u2014no matter how weak or poor or deprived one\u2019s  \fpresent situation may be."}, {"text": " So those people involved in Buddhist practice who suffer from self-hatred or self-loathing should avoid contemplating the suffering nature of existence or the underlying unsatisfactory nature of existence, and instead they should concentrate more on the positive aspects of one\u2019s existence, such as appreciating the tremendous potential that lies within oneself as a human being."}, {"text": " And by reflecting upon these opportunities and potentials, they will be able to increase their sense of worth and confidence in themselves.\u201d Raising my now-standard question from the perspective of a non-Buddhist, I asked, \u201cWell, what would be the antidote for someone who may not have heard of the concept of Buddha Nature or who may not be a Buddhist?\u201d \u201cOne thing in general that we could point out  \fto such people is that we are gifted as human beings with this wonderful human intelligence."}, {"text": " On top of that, all human beings have the capacity to be very determined and to direct that strong sense of determination in whatever direction they would like to use it. There is no doubt of this. So if one maintains an awareness of these potentials and reminds oneself of them repeatedly until it becomes part of one\u2019s customary way of perceiving human beings\u2014including oneself\u2014 then this could serve to help reduce feelings of discouragement, helplessness, and selfcontempt."}, {"text": "\u201d The Dalai Lama stopped for a moment, then proceeded with a probing inflection which suggested that he was still actively exploring, continuously engaging in a process of discovery. \u201cI think that here there might be some sort of  \fparallel to the way we treat physical illnesses. When doctors treat someone for a specific illness, not only do they give antibiotics for the specific condition, but they also make sure that the person\u2019s underlying physical condition is such that he or she can take antibiotics and tolerate them."}, {"text": " So in order to ensure that, the doctors make sure, for instance, that the person is generally well nourished, and often they may also have to give vitamins or whatever to build the body. So long as the person has that underlying strength in his or her body, then there is the potential or capacity within the body to heal itself from the illness through medication."}, {"text": " Similarly, so long as we know and maintain an awareness that we have this marvelous gift of human intelligence and a capacity to develop determination and use it in positive ways, in  \fsome sense we have this underlying mental health. An underlying strength, that comes from realizing we have this great human potential."}, {"text": " This realization can act as a sort of built-in mechanism that allows us to deal with any difficulty, no matter what situation we are facing, without losing hope or sinking into self-hatred.\u201d Reminding ourselves of the great qualities we share with all human beings acts to neutralize the impulse to think we\u2019re bad or undeserving."}, {"text": " Many Tibetans do this as a daily meditation practice. Perhaps that\u2019s the reason why in Tibetan culture self-hatred never took hold.  \fPart V  CLOSING REFLECTIONS ON LIVING A SPIRITUAL LIFE  \fChapter 15  BASIC SPIRITUAL VALUES  The art of happiness has many components. As we\u2019ve seen, it begins with developing an understanding of the truest sources of happiness and setting our priorities in life based on the  \fcultivation of those sources."}, {"text": " It involves an inner discipline, a gradual process of rooting out destructive mental states and replacing them with positive, constructive states of mind, such as kindness, tolerance, and forgiveness. In identifying the factors that lead to a full and satisfying life, we conclude with a discussion of the final component\u2014spirituality."}, {"text": " There is a natural tendency to associate spirituality with religion. The Dalai Lama\u2019s approach to achieving happiness has been shaped by his years of rigorous training as an ordained Buddhist monk. He is also widely regarded as a preeminent Buddhist scholar. For many, however, it is not his grasp of complex philosophical issues that offers the most appeal but rather his personal warmth, humor, and down-to-earth approach to life."}, {"text": " During the  \fcourse of our conversations, in fact, his basic humanness seemed to override even his primary role as a Buddhist monk. Despite his shaved head and striking maroon robes, despite his position as one of the most prominent religious figures in the world, the tone of our conversations was simply of one human being to another, discussing the problems that we all share."}, {"text": " In helping us understand the true meaning of spirituality, the Dalai Lama began by distinguishing between spirituality and religion: \u201cI believe that it is essential to appreciate our potential as human beings and recognize the importance of inner transformation. This should be achieved through what could be called a process of mental development."}, {"text": " Sometimes, I call this having a spiritual dimension in our life. \u201cThere can be two levels of spirituality. One  \flevel of spirituality has to do with our religious beliefs. In this world, there are so many different people, so many different dispositions. There are five billion human beings and in a certain way I think we need five billion different religions, because there is such a large variety of dispositions."}, {"text": " I believe that each individual should embark upon a spiritual path that is best suited to his or her mental disposition, natural inclination, temperament, belief, family, and cultural background. \u201cNow, for example, as a Buddhist monk, I find Buddhism to be most suitable. So, for myself, I\u2019ve found that Buddhism is best."}, {"text": " But that does not mean Buddhism is best for everyone. That\u2019s clear. It\u2019s definite. If I believed that Buddhism were best for everyone, that would be foolish, because different people have different  \fmental dispositions. So, the variety of people calls for a variety of religions. The purpose of religion is to benefit people, and I think that if we only had one religion, after a while it would cease to benefit many people."}, {"text": " If we had a restaurant, for instance, and it only served one dish\u2014day after day, for every meal\u2014that restaurant wouldn\u2019t have many customers left after a while. People need and appreciate diversity in their food because there are so many different tastes. In the same way, religions are meant to nourish the human spirit."}, {"text": " And I think we can learn to celebrate that diversity in religions and develop a deep appreciation of the variety of religions. So certain people may find Judaism, the Christian tradition, or the Islamic tradition to be most effective for them. Therefore, we must respect and appreciate the value of all the different major  \fworld religious traditions."}, {"text": " \u201cAll of these religions can make an effective contribution for the benefit of humanity. They are all designed to make the individual a happier person, and the world a better place. However, in order for the religion to have an impact in making the world a better place, I think it\u2019s important for the individual practitioner to sincerely practice the teachings of that religion."}, {"text": " One must integrate the religious teachings into one\u2019s life, wherever one is, so one can use them as a source of inner strength. And one must gain a deeper understanding of the religion\u2019s ideas, not just on an intellectual level but with a deep feeling, making them part of one\u2019s inner experience."}, {"text": " \u201cI believe that one can cultivate a deep respect for all the different religious traditions.  \fOne reason to respect these other traditions is that all of these traditions can provide an ethical framework which can govern one\u2019s behavior and have positive effects. For instance, in the Christian tradition a belief in God can provide one with a coherent and clear-cut ethical framework which can govern one\u2019s behavior and way of life\u2014and it can be a very powerful approach because there is a certain intimacy created in one\u2019s relationship with God, and the way to demonstrate one\u2019s love of God, the God who created you, is by showing love and compassion to one\u2019s fellow human beings."}, {"text": " \u201cI believe that there are many similar reasons to respect other religious traditions as well. All major religions, of course, have provided tremendous benefit for millions of human beings throughout many centuries in the past. And even  \fat this very moment, millions of people still get a benefit, get some kind of inspiration, from these different religious traditions."}, {"text": " It is clear. And in the future also, these different religious traditions will give inspiration to millions of coming generations. That is a fact. So therefore, it is very, very important to realize that reality and respect other traditions. \u201cI think that one way of strengthening that mutual respect is through closer contact between those of different religious faiths\u2014personal contact."}, {"text": " I have made efforts over the past few years to meet and have dialogues with, for example, the Christian community and the Jewish community, and I think that some really positive results have come of this. Through this kind of closer contact we can learn about the useful contributions that these religions have made to  \fhumanity and find useful aspects of the other traditions that we can learn from."}, {"text": " We may even discover methods and techniques that we can adopt in our own practice. \u201cSo, it is essential that we develop closer bonds among the various religions; through this we can make a common effort for the benefit of humanity. There are so many things that divide humanity, so many problems in the world."}, {"text": " Religion should be a remedy to help reduce the conflict and suffering in the world, not another source of conflict. \u201cWe often hear people say that all human beings are equal. By this we mean that everyone has the obvious desire of happiness. Everybody has the right to be a happy person. And everyone has the right to overcome suffering."}, {"text": " So if someone is deriving happiness or benefit from a  \fparticular religious tradition, it becomes important to respect the rights of others; thus we must learn to respect all these major religious traditions. That is clear.\u201d  During the Dalai Lama\u2019s week of talks in Tucson, the spirit of mutual respect was more than just wishful thinking."}, {"text": " Those of many different religious traditions were found among the audience, including a sizable representation of Christian clergy. Despite the differences in traditions, a peaceful and harmonious atmosphere pervaded the room. It was palpable. There was a spirit of exchange as well, and no little curiosity among the non-Buddhists present about the Dalai  \fLama\u2019s daily spiritual practice."}, {"text": " This curiosity prompted one listener to ask: \u201cWhether one is a Buddhist or of a different tradition, practices such as prayer seem to be emphasized. Why is prayer important for a spiritual life?\u201d The Dalai Lama answered, \u201cI think prayer is, for the most part, a simple daily reminder of your deeply held principles and convictions."}, {"text": " I, myself, repeat certain Buddhist verses every morning. The verses may look like prayers, but they are actually reminders. Reminders of how to speak to others, how to deal with other people, how to deal with problems in your daily life, things like that. So, for the most part, my practice involves reminders\u2014reviewing the importance of compassion, forgiveness, all these things."}, {"text": " And, of course, it also includes certain Buddhist  \fmeditations about the nature of reality, and also certain visualization practices. So, in my own daily practice, my own daily prayers, if I go leisurely, it takes about four hours. It\u2019s quite long.\u201d The thought of spending four hours a day in prayer prompted another listener to ask, \u201cI\u2019m a working mother with small children, with very little free time."}, {"text": " For someone who is really busy, how does one find the time to do these kinds of prayers and meditation practices?\u201d \u201cEven in my case, if I wish to complain, I can always complain about lack of time,\u201d the Dalai Lama remarked. \u201cI\u2019m very busy. However, if you make the effort, you can always find some time, say, in the early morning."}, {"text": " Then, I think there are some times like the weekend. You can sacrifice some of your fun,\u201d he laughed. \u201cSo at  \fleast, I think daily, say a half an hour. Or if you make the effort, try hard enough, perhaps you may be able to find, let us say, thirty minutes in the morning and thirty minutes in the evening."}, {"text": " If you really think about it, maybe it is possible to figure out a way of getting some time. \u201cHowever, if you think seriously about the true meaning of spiritual practices, it has to do with the development and training of your mental state, attitudes, and psychological and emotional state and well-being."}, {"text": " You should not confine your understanding of spiritual practice to terms of some physical activities or verbal activities, like doing recitations of prayers and chanting. If your understanding of spiritual practice is limited to only these activities, then, of course, you will need a specific time, a separate allotted time to do your practice\u2014because you can\u2019t go around  \fdoing your daily chores, like cooking and so on, while reciting mantras."}, {"text": " That could be quite annoying to people around you. However, if you understand spiritual practice in its true sense, then you can use all twenty-four hours of your day for your practice. True spirituality is a mental attitude that you can practice at any time. For example, if you find yourself in a situation in which you might be tempted to insult someone, then you immediately take precautions and restrain yourself from doing that."}, {"text": " Similarly, if you encounter a situation in which you may lose your temper, immediately you are mindful and say, \u2018No, this is not the appropriate way.\u2019 That actually is a spiritual practice. Seen in that light, you will always have time. \u201cThis reminds me of one of the Tibetan Kadampa masters, Potowa, who said that for a  \fmeditator who has a certain degree of inner stability and realization, every event, every experience you are exposed to comes as a kind of a teaching."}, {"text": " It\u2019s a learning experience. This I think is very true. \u201cSo, from this perspective, even when you are exposed to, for instance, disturbing scenes of violence and sex, like in TV and films, there is a possibility to view them with an underlying mindfulness of the harmful effects of going to extremes."}, {"text": " Then, instead of being totally overwhelmed by the sight, rather you can take these scenes as a kind of an indicator of the damaging nature of unchecked negative emotions \u2014something from which you can learn lessons.\u201d  \fBut learning lessons from old reruns of The ATeam or Melrose Place is one thing."}, {"text": " As a practicing Buddhist, however, the Dalai Lama\u2019s personal spiritual regimen certainly includes features unique to the Buddhist path. In describing his daily practice, for instance, he mentioned it includes Buddhist meditations on the nature of reality, as well as certain visualization practices."}, {"text": " While in the context of this discussion he mentioned these practices only in passing, over the years I\u2019ve had an opportunity to hear him discuss these topics at length\u2014his talks comprising some of the most complex discussions I\u2019ve ever heard on any subject. His talks on the nature of reality were filled with labyrinthine philosophical arguments and analyses; his descriptions of Tantric visualizations  \fwere inconceivably intricate and elaborate\u2014 meditations and visualizations whose objective seemed to be to construct within one\u2019s imagination a sort of holographic atlas of the universe."}, {"text": " He had spent a lifetime engaged in the study and practice of these Buddhist meditations. It was with this in mind, knowing the monumental scope of his efforts, that I asked him: \u201cCan you describe the practical benefit or impact these spiritual practices have had on your day-to-day life?\u201d The Dalai Lama was silent for several moments, then quietly replied, \u201cAlthough my own experience may be very little, one thing that I can say for certain is that I feel that through Buddhist training, I feel that my mind has become much more calm."}, {"text": " That\u2019s definite. Although the change has come about gradually, perhaps centimeter by  \fcentimeter,\u201d he laughed, \u201cI think that there has been a change in my attitude towards myself and others. Although it\u2019s difficult to point to the precise causes of this change, I think that it has been influenced by a realization, not full realization, but a certain feeling or sense of the underlying fundamental nature of reality, and also through contemplating subjects such as impermanence, our suffering nature, and the value of compassion and altruism."}, {"text": " \u201cSo, for example, even when thinking about those Communist Chinese who inflicted great harm on some of the Tibetan people\u2014as a result of my Buddhist training I feel a certain compassion towards even the torturer, because I understand that the torturer was in fact compelled by other negative forces."}, {"text": " Because of these things and my Bodhisattva vows and commitments,  \feven if a person committed atrocities, I simply cannot feel or think that because of their atrocities they should experience negative things or not experience a moment of happiness.6 The Bodhisattva vow has helped me develop this attitude; it has been very useful, so naturally I love this vow."}, {"text": " \u201cThis reminds me of one senior chant master who is staying at Namgyal Monastery. He was in Chinese prisons as a political prisoner and in labor camps for twenty years. Once I asked him what was the most difficult situation he faced when he was in prison. Surprisingly, he said that he felt the greatest danger was of losing compassion for the Chinese! \u201cThere are many such stories."}, {"text": " For example, three days ago I met a monk who spent many years in Chinese prisons. He told me that he was  \ftwenty-four years old at the time of the 1959 Tibetan uprising. At that time he joined the Tibetan forces in Norbulinga. He was caught by the Chinese and put in prison along with three brothers who were killed there."}, {"text": " Two other brothers were also killed. Then his parents died in a labor camp. But he told me that when he was in prison, he reflected on his life until then and concluded that even though he had spent his entire life as a monk at Drepung Monastery, until that time he felt that he was not a good monk."}, {"text": " He felt that he had been a stupid monk. At that moment he made a pledge that now that he was in prison, he would try to be a genuinely good monk. So as a result of his Buddhist practices, because of this training of the mind, he was able to remain mentally very happy even if he was in physical pain."}, {"text": " Even when he underwent torture  \fand severe beatings, he was able to survive it and still feel happy by viewing it as a cleansing of his past negative Karma. \u201cSo, through these examples, one can really appreciate the value of incorporating spiritual practices within one\u2019s everyday life.\u201d  Thus, the Dalai Lama added the final ingredient of a happier life\u2014the spiritual dimension."}, {"text": " Through the teachings of the Buddha, the Dalai Lama and many others have found a meaningful framework that enables them to endure and even transcend the pain and suffering that life sometimes brings. And as the Dalai Lama suggests, each of the world\u2019s major religious traditions can offer the same opportunities to help one achieve a happier life."}, {"text": " The power of faith,  \fgenerated on a widespread scale by these religious traditions, is interwoven in the lives of millions. That deep religious faith has sustained countless people through difficult times. Sometimes it operates in small quiet ways, sometimes in profound transformative experiences."}, {"text": " Every one of us, at some time during our lives, has no doubt witnessed that power operate on a family member, a friend, or an acquaintance. Occasionally, examples of the sustaining power of faith find their way onto the front pages. Many are familiar, for instance, with the ordeal of Terry Anderson, an ordinary man who was suddenly kidnapped off the street in Beirut one morning in 1985."}, {"text": " A blanket was thrown over him, he was shoved into a car, and for the next seven years he was held as a hostage by Hezbollah, a group of Islamic fundamentalist  \fextremists. Until 1991 he was imprisoned in damp, filthy basements and small cells, blindfolded and chained for extended periods, enduring regular beatings and harsh conditions."}, {"text": " When he was finally released, the world turned its eyes toward him and found a man overjoyed to be returned to his family and his life but with surprisingly little bitterness and hatred toward his captors. When questioned by reporters about the source of his remarkable strength, he identified faith and prayer as significant factors that helped him endure his ordeal."}, {"text": " The world is filled with such examples of the ways in which religious faith offers concrete help in times of trouble. And extensive recent surveys seem to confirm the fact that religious faith can substantially contribute to a happier life. Those conducted by independent researchers and  \fpolling organizations (such as the Gallup company) have found that religious people report feeling happy and satisfied with life more often than non-religious people."}, {"text": " Studies have found that not only is faith a predictor of self-reports of feelings of well-being, but a strong religious faith also appears to help individuals deal more effectively with issues such as aging or coping with personal crises and traumatic events. In addition, statistics show that families of those with strong religious belief often have lower rates of delinquency, alcohol and drug abuse, and ruined marriages."}, {"text": " There is even some evidence to suggest that faith may have benefits for people\u2019s physical health\u2014even for those with serious illnesses. There have, in fact, been literally hundreds of scientific and epi demiologic studies establishing a link between strong religious faith,  \flower death rates, and improved health."}, {"text": " In one study, elderly women with strong religious beliefs were able to walk farther after hip surgery than those with fewer religious convictions, and they were also less depressed following the surgery. A study done by Ronna Casar Harris and Mary Amanda Dew at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center found that heart-transplant patients with strong religious beliefs have less difficulty coping with postoperative medical regimens and display better long-term physical and emotional health."}, {"text": " In another, conducted by Dr. Thomas Oxman and his colleagues at Dartmouth Medical School, it was found that patients over the age of fifty-five who underwent open-heart surgery for coronary artery or heart valve disease and who had taken refuge in their religious beliefs were three times more likely to  \fsurvive than those who did not."}, {"text": " The benefits of a strong religious faith sometimes come about as a direct product of certain specific doctrines and beliefs of a particular tradition. Many Buddhists, for instance, are helped to endure their suffering as a result of their firm belief in the doctrine of Karma. In the same way, those who have an unshak able faith in God are often able to withstand intense hardship because of their belief in an omniscient and loving God\u2014a God whose plan may be obscure to us at present but One who, in His wisdom, will ultimately reveal His love for us."}, {"text": " With faith in the teachings of the Bible, they can take comfort in verses such as Romans 8:28: \u201cAll things work together for the good to them that love God, to them who are called according to His purpose.\u201d  \fAlthough some of the rewards of faith may be based on specific doctrines unique to a particular religious tradition, there are other strength-giving features of a spiritual life that are common to all religions."}, {"text": " Involvement in any religious group can create a feeling of belonging, communal ties, a caring connection with fellow practitioners. It offers a meaningful framework in which one can connect and relate with others. And it can give one a feeling of acceptance. Strongly held religious beliefs can give one a deep sense of purpose, providing meaning for one\u2019s life."}, {"text": " These beliefs can offer hope in the face of adversity, suffering, and death. They can help one adopt an eternal perspective that allows one to get outside of oneself when overwhelmed by life\u2019s daily problems. Although all these potential benefits are  \favailable to those who choose to practice the teachings of an established religion, it is clear that having a religious belief alone is no guarantee of happiness and peace."}, {"text": " For example, at the very same moment Terry Anderson sat chained in a cell demonstrating the finest attributes of religious faith, just outside his cell raged mass violence and hatred demonstrating the very worst attributes of religious faith. For years in Lebanon, various sects of Muslims were at war with Christians and Jews, fueled by violent hatred on all sides and resulting in unspeakable atrocities committed in the name of faith."}, {"text": " It\u2019s an old story, and one that has been told too often throughout history and repeated too often in the modern world. Because of this potential to breed divisiveness and hatred, it is easy to lose faith in religious institutions. This has led some religious figures  \fsuch as the Dalai Lama to try to distill those elements of a spiritual life that can be universally applied by any individual to enhance his or her happiness, regardless of religious tradition or whether he or she believes in religion."}, {"text": "  Thus, with a tone of complete conviction, the Dalai Lama concluded his discussion with his vision of a truly spiritual life: \u201cSo, in speaking of having a spiritual dimension to our lives, we have identified our religious beliefs as one level of spirituality. Now regarding religion, if we believe in any religion, that\u2019s good."}, {"text": " But even without a religious belief, we can still manage. In some cases, we can  \fmanage even better. But that\u2019s our own individual right; if we wish to believe, good! If not, it\u2019s all right. But then there\u2019s another level of spirituality. That is what I call basic spirituality\u2014basic human qualities of goodness, kindness, compassion, caring."}, {"text": " Whether we are believers or nonbelievers, this kind of spirituality is essential. I personally consider this second level of spirituality to be more important than the first, because no matter how wonderful a particular religion may be, it will still only be accepted by a limited number of human beings, only a portion of humanity."}, {"text": " But as long as we are human beings, as long as we are members of the human family, all of us need these basic spiritual values. Without these, human existence remains hard, very dry. As a result, none of us can be a happy person, our whole family will suffer, and then, eventually,  \fsociety will be more troubled."}, {"text": " So, it becomes clear that cultivating these kinds of basic spiritual values becomes crucial. \u201cIn seeking to cultivate these basic spiritual values, I think we need to remember that out of the, say, five billion human beings on this planet, I think perhaps one or two billion are very sincere, genuine believers in religion."}, {"text": " Of course, when I refer to sincere believers, I\u2019m not including those people who simply say, for example, \u2018I am Christian\u2019 mainly because their family background is Christian but in daily life may not consider very much about the Christian faith or actively practice it. So excluding these people, I believe that there are perhaps only around one billion who sincerely practice their religion."}, {"text": " That means that four billion, the majority of the people on this earth, are nonbelievers. So we must still  \ffind a way to try to improve life for this majority of the people, the four billion people who aren\u2019t involved in a specific religion\u2014ways to help them become good human beings, moral people, without any religion."}, {"text": " Here I think that education is crucial\u2014instilling in people a sense that compassion, kindness, and so on are the basic good qualities of human beings, not just a matter of religious subjects. I think earlier we spoke at greater length about the prime importance of human warmth, affection, and compassion in people\u2019s physical health, happiness, and peace of mind."}, {"text": " This is a very practical issue, not religious theory or philosophical speculation. It is a key issue. And I think that this is in fact the essence of all the religious teachings of the different traditions. But it remains just as crucial for those who choose not to follow any particular religion.  \fFor those people, I think we can educate them and impress upon them that it\u2019s all right to remain without any religion but be a good human being, a sensible human being, with a sense of responsibility and commitment for a better, happier world."}, {"text": " \u201cIn general, it is possible to indicate your particular religious or spiritual way of life through external means, such as wearing certain clothes, or having a shrine or altar in your house, or doing recitations and chanting, and so on. There are ways of demonstrating that externally. However, these practices or activities are secondary to your conducting a truly spiritual way of life, based on the basic spiritual values, because it is possible that all of these external religious activities can still go along with a person\u2019s harboring a very negative state of mind."}, {"text": " But true spirituality should  \fhave the result of making a person calmer, happier, more peaceful. \u201cAll of the virtuous states of mind\u2014 compassion, tolerance, forgiveness, caring, and so on\u2014these mental qualities are genuine Dharma, or genuine spiritual qualities, because all of these internal mental qualities cannot coexist with ill feelings or negative states of mind."}, {"text": " \u201cSo, engaging in training or a method of bringing about inner discipline within one\u2019s mind is the essence of a religious life, an inner discipline that has the purpose of cultivating these positive mental states. Thus, whether one leads a spiritual life depends on whether one has been successful in bringing about that disciplined, tamed state of mind and translating that state of mind into one\u2019s daily actions."}, {"text": "\u201d  \fThe Dalai Lama was due to attend a small reception held in honor of a group of donors who had been strong supporters of the Tibetan cause. Outside the reception room a large crowd had gathered in anticipation of his appearance. By the time of his arrival the crowd had become quite dense. Among the onlookers I saw a man whom I had noticed a couple of times during the week."}, {"text": " He was of indeterminate age, although I would have guessed middle twenties, maybe early thirties, tall and very thin. Notable for his disheveled appearance, he, however, had caught my attention because of his expression, one that I had frequently seen among my patients\u2014anxious, profoundly depressed, in pain."}, {"text": " And I thought I noticed slight repetitive involuntary movements of  \fthe musculature around his mouth. \u201cTardive dyskinesia,\u201d I had silently diagnosed, a neurological condition caused by chronic use of antipsychotic medication. \u201cPoor guy,\u201d I thought at the time but quickly forgot about him. As the Dalai Lama arrived, the crowd condensed, pressing forward to greet him."}, {"text": " The security staff, most of them volunteers, struggled to hold back the advancing mass of people and clear a path to the reception room. The troubled young man whom I had seen earlier, now with a somewhat bewildered expression, was crushed forward by the crowd and pushed to the edge of the clearing made by the security team."}, {"text": " As the Dalai Lama made his way through, he noticed the man, broke free from the mooring of the security crew, and stopped to talk to him. The man was startled at first and began to speak very rapidly  \fto the Dalai Lama, who spoke a few words in return. I couldn\u2019t hear what they were saying, but I saw that as the man spoke, he started to become visibly more agitated."}, {"text": " The man was saying something, but instead of responding, the Dalai Lama spontaneously took the man\u2019s hand between his, patted it gently, and for several moments simply stood there silently nodding. As he held the man\u2019s hand firmly, looking into his eyes, it seemed as if he were unaware of the mass of people around him."}, {"text": " The look of pain and agitation suddenly seemed to drain from the man\u2019s face and tears ran down his cheeks. Although the smile that surfaced and slowly spread across his features was thin, a look of comfort and gladness appeared in the man\u2019s eyes. The Dalai Lama has repeatedly emphasized  \fthat inner discipline is the basis of a spiritual life."}, {"text": " It is the fundamental method of achieving happiness. As he explained throughout this book, from his perspective inner discipline involves combating negative states of mind such as anger, hatred, and greed, and cultivating positive states such as kindness, compassion, and tolerance. He also has pointed out that a happy life is built on a foundation of a calm, stable state of mind."}, {"text": " The practice of inner discipline can include formal meditation techniques that are intended to help stabilize the mind and achieve that calm state. Most spiritual traditions include practices that seek to quiet the mind, to put us more in touch with our deeper spiritual nature. At the conclusion of the Dalai Lama\u2019s series of public talks in Tucson, he presented instruction on one meditation designed to help us begin to quiet our  \fthoughts, observe the underlying nature of the mind, and thus develop a \u201cstillness of mind."}, {"text": "\u201d Looking out over the assembly, he began to speak in his characteristic manner as if, instead of addressing a large group, he was personally instructing each individual in the audience. At times he was still and focused, at times more animated, choreo graphing his instruction with subtle head nods, hand gestures, and gentle rocking motions."}, {"text": "  \fMEDITATION ON THE NATURE OF THE MIND  \u201cThe purpose of this exercise is to begin to recognize and get a feel for the nature of our mind,\u201d he began, \u201cat least on a conventional level. Generally, when we refer to our \u2018mind,\u2019 we are talking about an abstract concept. Without having a direct experience of our mind, for example, if we are asked to identify the mind, we may be compelled to merely point to the brain."}, {"text": " Or, if we are asked to define the mind, we may say it is something that has the capacity to \u2018know,\u2019 something that is \u2018clear\u2019 and \u2019cognitive.\u2018 But without having directly grasped the mind through  \fmeditative practices, these definitions are just words. It\u2019s important to be able to identify the mind through direct experience, not just as an abstract concept."}, {"text": " So the purpose of this exercise is to be able to directly feel or grasp the conventional nature of the mind, so when you say the mind has qualities of \u2019clarity\u2019 and \u2018cognition,\u2019 you will be able to identify it through experience, not just as an abstract concept. \u201cThis exercise helps you to deliberately stop the discursive thoughts and gradually remain in that state for longer and longer duration."}, {"text": " As you practice this exercise, eventually you will get to a feeling as if there is nothing there, a sense of vacuity. But if you go farther, you eventually begin to recognize the underlying nature of the mind, the qualities of \u2018clarity\u2019 and \u2019knowing.\u2018 It is similar to having a pure crystal glass full of water."}, {"text": "  \fIf the water is pure, you can see the bottom of the glass, but you still recognize that the water is there. \u201cSo, today, let us meditate on nonconceptuality. This is not a mere state of dullness, or a blanked-out state of mind. Rather, what you should do is, first of all, generate the determination that \u2018I will maintain a state without conceptual thoughts."}, {"text": "\u2019 The way in which you should do that is this: \u201cGenerally speaking, our mind is predominantly directed towards external objects. Our attention follows after the sense experiences. It remains at a predominantly sensory and conceptual level. In other words, normally our awareness is directed towards physical sensory experiences and mental concepts."}, {"text": " But in this exercise, what you should do is to withdraw your  \fmind inward; don\u2019t let it chase after or pay attention to sensory objects. At the same time, don\u2019t allow it to be so totally withdrawn that there is a kind of dullness or lack of mindfulness. You should maintain a very full state of alertness and mindfulness, and then try to see the natural state of your consciousness\u2014a state in which your consciousness is not afflicted by thoughts of the past, the things that have happened, your memories and remembrances; nor is it afflicted by thoughts of the future, like your future plans, anticipations, fears, and hopes."}, {"text": " But rather, try to remain in a natural and neutral state. \u201cThis is a bit like a river that is flowing quite strongly, in which you cannot see the riverbed very clearly. If, however, there was some way you could stop the flow in both directions, from where the water is coming and to where the  \fwater is flowing, then you could keep the water still."}, {"text": " That would allow you to see the base of the river quite clearly. Similarly, when you are able to stop your mind from chasing sensory objects and thinking about the past and future and so on, and when you can free your mind from being totally \u2018blanked out\u2019 as well, then you will begin to see underneath this turbulence of the thought processes."}, {"text": " There is an underlying stillness, an underlying clarity of the mind. You should try to observe or experience this ... \u201cThis can be very difficult at the initial stage, so let us begin to practice from this very session. At the initial stage, when you begin to experience this underlying natural state of consciousness, you might experience it in the form of some sort of \u2018absence."}, {"text": "\u2019 This is happening because we are so habituated to understanding our mind in terms of  \fexternal objects; we tend to look at the world through our concepts, images, and so on. So when you withdraw your mind from external objects, it\u2019s almost as if you can\u2019t recognize your mind. There\u2019s a kind of absence, a kind of vacuity."}, {"text": " However, as you slowly progress and get used to it, you begin to notice an underlying clarity, a luminosity. That\u2019s when you begin to appreciate and realize the natural state of the mind. \u201cMany of the truly profound meditative experiences must come on the basis of this kind of stillness of mind."}, {"text": "... Oh,\u201d the Dalai Lama laughed, \u201cI should warn that in this type of meditation, since there is no specific object to focus on, there is a danger of falling asleep. \u201cSo, now let us meditate ... \u201cTo begin, first do three rounds of breathing,  \fand focus your attention simply on the breath. Just be aware of inhaling, exhaling, and then inhaling, exhaling\u2014three times."}, {"text": " Then, start the meditation.\u201d The Dalai Lama removed his glasses, folded his hands in his lap, and remained motionless in meditation. Total silence pervaded the hall, as fifteen hundred people turned inward, in the solitude of fifteen hundred private worlds, seeking to still their thoughts and perhaps catch a glimpse of the true nature of their own mind."}, {"text": " After five minutes, the silence was cracked but not broken as the Dalai Lama began to chant softly, his voice low and melodic, gently leading his listeners from their meditation. At the close of the session that day, as always, the Dalai Lama folded his hands together, bowed to his audience out of affection and respect, rose, and made his  \fway through the surrounding crowd."}, {"text": " His hands remained clasped together and he continued to bow as he left the room. As he walked through the dense crowd he bowed so low, in fact, that for anyone who stood more than a few feet away, it was impossible to see him. He appeared to be lost in a sea of heads.

Subtlety #1: Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.  \fLet\u2019s be clear."}, {"text": " There\u2019s absolutely nothing admirable or confident about indifference. People who are indifferent are lame and scared. They\u2019re couch potatoes and Internet trolls. In fact, indifferent people often attempt to be indifferent because in reality they give way too many fucks. They give a fuck about what everyone thinks of their hair, so they never bother washing or combing it."}, {"text": " They give a fuck about what everyone thinks of their ideas, so they hide behind sarcasm and self-righteous snark. They\u2019re afraid to let anyone get close to them, so they imagine themselves as some special, unique snowflake who has problems that nobody else would ever  \funderstand. Indifferent people are afraid of the world and the repercussions of their own choices."}, {"text": " That\u2019s why they don\u2019t make any meaningful choices. They hide in a gray, emotionless pit of their own making, self-absorbed and self-pitying, perpetually distracting themselves from this unfortunate thing demanding their time and energy called life. Because here\u2019s a sneaky truth about life. There\u2019s no such thing as not giving a fuck."}, {"text": " You must give a fuck about something. It\u2019s part of our biology to always care about something and therefore to always give a fuck. The question, then, is, What do we  \fgive a fuck about? What are we choosing to give a fuck about? And how can we not give a fuck about what ultimately does not matter? My mother was recently screwed out of a large chunk of money by a close friend of hers."}, {"text": " Had I been indifferent, I would have shrugged my shoulders, sipped my mocha, and downloaded another season of The Wire. Sorry, Mom. But instead, I was indignant. I was pissed off. I said, \u201cNo, screw that, Mom. We\u2019re going to lawyer the fuck up and go after this asshole. Why? Because I don\u2019t give a fuck."}, {"text": " I will ruin this guy\u2019s life if I have to.\u201d This illustrates the first subtlety of  \fnot giving a fuck. When we say, \u201cDamn, watch out, Mark Manson just don\u2019t give a fuck,\u201d we don\u2019t mean that Mark Manson doesn\u2019t care about anything; on the contrary, we mean that Mark Manson doesn\u2019t care about adversity in the face of his goals, he doesn\u2019t care about pissing some people off to do what he feels is right or important or noble."}, {"text": " We mean that Mark Manson is the type of guy who would write about himself in third person just because he thought it was the right thing to do.

The people who don\u2019t give a fuck about adversity or failure or embarrassing themselves or shitting the bed a few times. The people who just laugh and then do what they believe in anyway. Because they know it\u2019s right."}, {"text": " They know it\u2019s more important than they are, more important than their own feelings and their own pride and their own ego. They say, \u201cFuck it,\u201d not to everything in life, but rather to everything unimportant in life. They reserve their fucks for what truly matters. Friends. Family. Purpose.  \fBurritos."}, {"text": " And an occasional lawsuit or two. And because of that, because they reserve their fucks for only the big things that matter, people give a fuck about them in return. Because here\u2019s another sneaky little truth about life. You can\u2019t be an important and life-changing presence for some people without also being a joke and an embarrassment to others."}, {"text": " You just can\u2019t. Because there\u2019s no such thing as a lack of adversity. It doesn\u2019t exist. The old saying goes that no matter where you go, there you are. Well, the same is true for adversity and failure. No matter where you go, there\u2019s a five-hundredpound load of shit waiting for you. And  \fthat\u2019s perfectly fine."}, {"text": " The point isn\u2019t to get away from the shit. The point is to find the shit you enjoy dealing with. Subtlety #2: To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity. Imagine you\u2019re at a grocery store, and you watch an elderly lady scream at the cashier, berating him for not accepting her thirty-cent coupon."}, {"text": " Why does this lady give a fuck? It\u2019s just thirty cents. I\u2019ll tell you why: That lady probably doesn\u2019t have anything better to do with her days than to sit at home cutting out coupons. She\u2019s old and lonely.

She can\u2019t fart without extreme lower-back pain."}, {"text": " Her pension is on its last legs, and she\u2019s probably going to die in a diaper thinking she\u2019s in Candy Land.

And so when that pimply-faced seventeen-year-old cashier refuses to accept one of them, when he defends his cash register\u2019s purity the way knights used to defend maidens\u2019 virginity, you can bet Granny is going to erupt."}, {"text": " Eighty years of fucks will rain down all at  \fonce, like a fiery hailstorm of \u201cBack in my day\u201d and \u201cPeople used to show more respect\u201d stories. The problem with people who hand out fucks like ice cream at a goddamn summer camp is that they don\u2019t have anything more fuck-worthy to dedicate their fucks to."}, {"text": " If you find yourself consistently giving too many fucks about trivial shit that bothers you\u2014your ex-boyfriend\u2019s new Facebook picture, how quickly the batteries die in the TV remote, missing out on yet another two-for-one sale on hand sanitizer\u2014chances are you don\u2019t have much going on in your life to give a legitimate fuck about."}, {"text": " And that\u2019s your  \freal problem.

I think what most people\u2014 especially educated, pampered middleclass white people\u2014consider \u201clife problems\u201d are really just side effects of not having anything more important to worry about."}, {"text": " It then follows that finding something important and meaningful in your life is perhaps the most productive use of your time and energy. Because if you don\u2019t find that meaningful something, your fucks will be given to meaningless and  \ffrivolous causes. Subtlety #3: Whether you realize it or not, you are always choosing what to give a fuck about."}, {"text": " People aren\u2019t just born not giving a fuck. In fact, we\u2019re born giving way too many fucks. Ever watch a kid cry his eyes out because his hat is the wrong shade of blue? Exactly. Fuck that kid. When we\u2019re young, everything is new and exciting, and everything seems to matter so much. Therefore, we give tons of fucks."}, {"text": " We give a fuck about everything and everyone\u2014about what people are saying about us, about whether that cute boy/girl called us back or not, about whether our socks match or  \fnot, or what color our birthday balloon is. As we get older, with the benefit of experience (and having seen so much time slip by), we begin to notice that most of these sorts of things have little lasting impact on our lives."}, {"text": " Those people whose opinions we cared about so much before are no longer present in our lives. Rejections that were painful in the moment have actually worked out for the best. We realize how little attention people pay to the superficial details about us, and we choose not to obsess so much over them."}, {"text": " Essentially, we become more selective about the fucks we\u2019re willing  \fto give. This is something called maturity. It\u2019s nice; you should try it sometime. Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about what\u2019s truly fuckworthy. As Bunk Moreland said to his partner Detective McNulty in The Wire (which, fuck you, I still downloaded): \u201cThat\u2019s what you get for giving a fuck when it wasn\u2019t your turn to give a fuck."}, {"text": "\u201d Then, as we grow older and enter middle age, something else begins to change. Our energy level drops. Our identity solidifies. We know who we are and we accept ourselves, including some of the parts we aren\u2019t thrilled about. And, in a strange way, this is  \fliberating. We no longer need to give a fuck about everything."}, {"text": " Life is just what it is. We accept it, warts and all. We realize that we\u2019re never going to cure cancer or go to the moon or feel Jennifer Aniston\u2019s tits. And that\u2019s okay. Life goes on. We now reserve our ever-dwindling fucks for the most truly fuck-worthy parts of our lives: our families, our best friends, our golf swing."}, {"text": " And, to our astonishment, this is enough. This simplification actually makes us really fucking happy on a consistent basis. And we start to think, Maybe that crazy alcoholic Bukowski was onto something. Don\u2019t try.  \fSo Mark, What the Fuck Is the Point of This Book Anyway?

I know that sounds intellectually lazy on the surface, but I promise you, it\u2019s a life/death sort of issue. Because when we believe that it\u2019s not okay for things to suck sometimes, then we unconsciously start blaming  \fourselves."}, {"text": " We start to feel as though something is inherently wrong with us, which drives us to all sorts of overcompensation, like buying forty pairs of shoes or downing Xanax with a vodka chaser on a Tuesday night or shooting up a school bus full of kids. This belief that it\u2019s not okay to be inadequate sometimes is the source of the growing Feedback Loop from Hell that is coming to dominate our culture."}, {"text": " The idea of not giving a fuck is a simple way of reorienting our expectations for life and choosing what is important and what is not. Developing this ability leads to something I like to think of as a kind of \u201cpractical  \fenlightenment.\u201d No, not that airy-fairy, eternal bliss, end-of-all-suffering, bullshitty kind of enlightenment."}, {"text": " On the contrary, I see practical enlightenment as becoming comfortable with the idea that some suffering is always inevitable\u2014that no matter what you do, life is comprised of failures, loss, regrets, and even death. Because once you become comfortable with all the shit that life throws at you (and it will throw a lot of shit, trust me), you become invincible in a sort of lowlevel spiritual way."}, {"text": " After all, the only way to overcome pain is to first learn how to bear it. This book doesn\u2019t give a fuck about  \falleviating your problems or your pain. And that is precisely why you will know it\u2019s being honest. This book is not some guide to greatness\u2014it couldn\u2019t be, because greatness is merely an illusion in our minds, a made-up destination that we obligate ourselves to pursue, our own psychological Atlantis."}, {"text": " Instead, this book will turn your pain into a tool, your trauma into power, and your problems into slightly better problems. That is real progress. Think of it as a guide to suffering and how to do it better, more meaningfully, with more compassion and more humility. It\u2019s a book about moving lightly despite your heavy burdens, resting easier with your  \fgreatest fears, laughing at your tears as you cry them."}, {"text": " This book will not teach you how to gain or achieve, but rather how to lose and let go. It will teach you to take inventory of your life and scrub out all but the most important items. It will teach you to close your eyes and trust that you can fall backwards and still be okay. It will teach you to give fewer fucks."}, {"text": " It will teach you to not try.  \fCHAPTER 2  Happiness Is a Problem  About twenty-five hundred years ago, in the Himalayan foothills of present-day Nepal, there lived in a great palace a king who was going to have a son. For this son the king had a particularly grand idea: he would make the child\u2019s life perfect."}, {"text": " The child would never know a moment of suffering\u2014every need, every  \fdesire, would be accounted for at all times. The king built high walls around the palace that prevented the prince from knowing the outside world. He spoiled the child, lavishing him with food and gifts, surrounding him with servants who catered to his every whim."}, {"text": " And just as planned, the child grew up ignorant of the routine cruelties of human existence. All of the prince\u2019s childhood went on like this. But despite the endless luxury and opulence, the prince became kind of a pissed-off young man. Soon, every experience felt empty and valueless. The problem was that no matter what his father gave him, it never  \fseemed enough, never meant anything."}, {"text": " So late one night, the prince snuck out of the palace to see what was beyond its walls. He had a servant drive him through the local village, and what he saw horrified him. For the first time in his life, the prince saw human suffering. He saw sick people, old people, homeless people, people in pain, even people dying."}, {"text": " The prince returned to the palace and found himself in a sort of existential crisis. Not knowing how to process what he\u2019d seen, he got all emo about everything and complained a lot. And, as is so typical of young men, the prince ended up blaming his father for the very  \fthings his father had tried to do for him."}, {"text": " It was the riches, the prince thought, that had made him so miserable, that had made life seem so meaningless. He decided to run away. But the prince was more like his father than he knew. He had grand ideas too. He wouldn\u2019t just run away; he would give up his royalty, his family, and all of his possessions and live in the streets, sleeping in dirt like an animal."}, {"text": " There he would starve himself, torture himself, and beg for scraps of food from strangers for the rest of his life. The next night, the prince snuck out of the palace again, this time never to return. For years he lived as a bum, a  \fdiscarded and forgotten remnant of society, the dog shit caked to the bottom of the social totem pole."}, {"text": " And as planned, the prince suffered greatly. He suffered through disease, hunger, pain, loneliness, and decay. He confronted the brink of death itself, often limited to eating a single nut each day. A few years went by. Then a few more. And then . . . nothing happened. The prince began to notice that this life of suffering wasn\u2019t all that it was cracked up to be."}, {"text": " It wasn\u2019t bringing him the insight he had desired. It wasn\u2019t revealing any deeper mystery of the world or its ultimate purpose. In fact, the prince came to know  \fwhat the rest of us have always kind of known: that suffering totally sucks. And it\u2019s not necessarily that meaningful either. As with being rich, there is no value in suffering when it\u2019s done without purpose."}, {"text": " And soon the prince came to the conclusion that his grand idea, like his father\u2019s, was in fact a fucking terrible idea and he should probably go do something else instead. Totally confused, the prince cleaned himself up and went and found a big tree near a river. He decided that he would sit under that tree and not get up until he came up with another grand idea."}, {"text": " As the legend goes, the confused prince sat under that tree for forty-nine  \fdays. We won\u2019t delve into the biological viability of sitting in the same spot for forty-nine days, but let\u2019s just say that in that time the prince came to a number of profound realizations. One of those realizations was this: that life itself is a form of suffering."}, {"text": " The rich suffer because of their riches. The poor suffer because of their poverty. People without a family suffer because they have no family. People with a family suffer because of their family. People who pursue worldly pleasures suffer because of their worldly pleasures. People who abstain from worldly pleasures suffer because of their abstention."}, {"text": "  \fThis isn\u2019t to say that all suffering is equal. Some suffering is certainly more painful than other suffering. But we all must suffer nonetheless. Years later, the prince would build his own philosophy and share it with the world, and this would be its first and central tenet: that pain and loss are inevitable and we should let go of trying to resist them."}, {"text": " The prince would later become known as the Buddha. And in case you haven\u2019t heard of him, he was kind of a big deal. There is a premise that underlies a lot of our assumptions and beliefs. The premise is that happiness is algorithmic, that it can be worked for and earned and  \fachieved as if it were getting accepted to law school or building a really complicated Lego set."}, {"text": " If I achieve X, then I can be happy. If I look like Y, then I can be happy. If I can be with a person like Z, then I can be happy. This premise, though, is the problem. Happiness is not a solvable equation. Dissatisfaction and unease are inherent parts of human nature and, as we\u2019ll see, necessary components to creating consistent happiness."}, {"text": " The Buddha argued this from a theological and philosophical perspective. I will make the same argument in this chapter, but I will make it from a biological perspective, and with pandas.  \fThe Misadventures Disappointment Panda  of  If I could invent a superhero, I would invent one called Disappointment Panda."}, {"text": " He\u2019d wear a cheesy eye mask and a shirt (with a giant capital T on it) that was way too small for his big panda belly, and his superpower would be to tell people harsh truths about themselves that they needed to hear but didn\u2019t want to accept. He would go door-to-door like a Bible salesman and ring doorbells and say things like, \u201cSure, making a lot of money makes you feel good, but it won\u2019t make your kids love you,\u201d or \u201cIf you have to ask yourself if you trust your  \fwife, then you probably don\u2019t,\u201d or \u201cWhat you consider \u2018friendship\u2019 is really just your constant attempts to impress people."}, {"text": "\u201d Then he\u2019d tell the homeowner to have a nice day and saunter on down to the next house. It would be awesome. And sick. And sad. And uplifting. And necessary. After all, the greatest truths in life are usually the most unpleasant to hear. Disappointment Panda would be the hero that none of us would want but all of us would need."}, {"text": " He\u2019d be the proverbial vegetables to our mental diet of junk food. He\u2019d make our lives better despite making us feel worse. He\u2019d make us stronger by tearing us down,  \fbrighten our future by showing us the darkness. Listening to him would be like watching a movie where the hero dies in the end: you love it even more despite making you feel horrible, because it feels real."}, {"text": " So while we\u2019re here, allow me to put on my Disappointment Panda mask and drop another unpleasant truth on you: We suffer for the simple reason that suffering is biologically useful. It is nature\u2019s preferred agent for inspiring change. We have evolved to always live with a certain degree of dissatisfaction and insecurity, because it\u2019s the mildly dissatisfied and insecure creature that\u2019s  \fgoing to do the most work to innovate and survive."}, {"text": " We are wired to become dissatisfied with whatever we have and satisfied by only what we do not have. This constant dissatisfaction has kept our species fighting and striving, building and conquering. So no\u2014our own pain and misery aren\u2019t a bug of human evolution; they\u2019re a feature. Pain, in all of its forms, is our body\u2019s most effective means of spurring action."}, {"text": " Take something as simple as stubbing your toe. If you\u2019re like me, when you stub your toe you scream enough four-letter words to make Pope Francis cry.

We get to my locker."}, {"text": " \u201cOpen it, please,\u201d Mr. Price says; so I do.

He closes the door and locks it. He goes over to the window and adjusts the blinds to block the view from outside. My palms begin to sweat. This is not a normal principal visit.

It spreads from my palms to my arms and now my neck. My temples pulsate as blood floods my brain and  \fface.

Others do it by taking off across the world to save starving babies in Africa."}, {"text": " Others do it by excelling in school and winning every award. Others do it by shooting up a school. Others do it by trying to have sex with anything that talks and breathes. This ties in to the growing culture of entitlement that I talked about earlier.  \fMillennials often get blamed for this cultural shift, but that\u2019s likely because millennials are the most plugged-in and visible generation."}, {"text": " In fact, the tendency toward entitlement is apparent across all of society. And I believe it\u2019s linked to mass-media-driven exceptionalism. The problem is that the pervasiveness of technology and mass marketing is screwing up a lot of people\u2019s expectations for themselves. The inundation of the exceptional makes people feel worse about themselves, makes them feel that they need to be more extreme, more radical, and more self-assured to get noticed or even matter."}, {"text": "  \fWhen I was a young man, my insecurities around intimacy were exacerbated by all the ridiculous narratives of masculinity circulating throughout pop culture. And those same narratives are still circulating: to be a cool guy, you have to party like a rock star; to be respected, you have to be admired by women; sex is the most valuable thing a man can attain, and it\u2019s worth sacrificing anything (including your own dignity) to get it."}, {"text": " This constant stream of unrealistic media dogpiles onto our existing feelings of insecurity, by overexposing us to the unrealistic standards we fail to live up to.

Their economy was floundering, their military overstretched across half of Asia, and the territories they had won throughout the Pacific were now toppling like dominoes to U."}, {"text": "S. forces. Defeat seemed  \finevitable. On December 26, 1944, Second Lieutenant Hiroo Onoda of the Japanese Imperial Army was deployed to the small island of Lubang in the Philippines. His orders were to slow the United States\u2019 progress as much as possible, to stand and fight at all costs, and to never surrender."}, {"text": " Both he and his commander knew it was essentially a suicide mission. In February 1945, the Americans arrived on Lubang and took the island with overwhelming force. Within days, most of the Japanese soldiers had either surrendered or been killed, but Onoda and three of his men managed to hide in  \fthe jungle."}, {"text": " From there, they began a guerrilla warfare campaign against the U.S. forces and the local population, attacking supply lines, shooting at stray soldiers, and interfering with the American forces in any way that they could. That August, half a year later, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki."}, {"text": " Japan surrendered, and the deadliest war in human history came to its dramatic conclusion. However, thousands of Japanese soldiers were still scattered among the Pacific isles, and most, like Onoda, were hiding in the jungle, unaware that  \fthe war was over. These holdouts continued to fight and pillage as they had before."}, {"text": " This was a real problem for rebuilding eastern Asia after the war, and the governments agreed something must be done. The U.S. military, in conjunction with the Japanese government, dropped thousands of leaflets throughout the Pacific region, announcing that the war was over and it was time for everyone to go home."}, {"text": " Onoda and his men, like many others, found and read these leaflets, but unlike most of the others, Onoda decided that they were fake, a trap set by the American forces to get the guerrilla fighters to show themselves. Onoda  \fburned the leaflets, and he and his men stayed hidden and continued to fight."}, {"text": " Five years went by. The leaflets had stopped, and most of the American forces had long since gone home. The local population on Lubang attempted to return to their normal lives of farming and fishing. Yet there were Hiroo Onoda and his merry men, still shooting at the farmers, burning their crops, stealing their livestock, and murdering locals who wandered too far into the jungle."}, {"text": " The Philippine government then took to drawing up new flyers and spreading them out across the jungle. Come out, they said. The war is over. You lost. But these, too, were ignored.  \fIn 1952, the Japanese government made one final effort to draw the last remaining soldiers out of hiding throughout the Pacific."}, {"text": " This time, letters and pictures from the missing soldiers\u2019 families were air-dropped, along with a personal note from the emperor himself. Once again, Onoda refused to believe that the information was real. Once again, he believed the airdrop to be a trick by the Americans. Once again, he and his men stood and continued to fight."}, {"text": " Another few years went by and the Philippine locals, sick of being terrorized, finally armed themselves and began firing back. By 1959, one of Onoda\u2019s companions had surrendered,  \fand another had been killed. Then, a decade later, Onoda\u2019s last companion, a man called Kozuka, was killed in a shootout with the local police while he was burning rice fields\u2014still waging war against the local population a full quarter-century after the end of World War II! Onoda, having now spent more than half of his life in the jungles of Lubang, was all alone."}, {"text": " In 1972, the news of Kozuka\u2019s death reached Japan and caused a stir. The Japanese people thought the last of the soldiers from the war had come home years earlier. The Japanese media began to wonder: if Kozuka had still been on  \fLubang until 1972, then perhaps Onoda himself, the last known Japanese holdout from World War II, might still be alive as well."}, {"text": " That year, both the Japanese and Philippine governments sent search parties to look for the enigmatic second lieutenant, now part myth, part hero, and part ghost. They found nothing. As the months progressed, the story of Lieutenant Onoda morphed into something of an urban legend in Japan\u2014 the war hero who sounded too insane to actually exist."}, {"text": " Many romanticized him. Others criticized him. Others thought he was the stuff of fairy tale, invented by those who still wanted to believe in a  \fJapan that had disappeared long ago. It was around this time that a young man named Norio Suzuki first heard of Onoda. Suzuki was an adventurer, an explorer, and a bit of a hippie."}, {"text": " Born after the war ended, he had dropped out of school and spent four years hitchhiking his way across Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, sleeping on park benches, in stranger\u2019s cars, in jail cells, and under the stars. He volunteered on farms for food, and donated blood to pay for places to stay."}, {"text": " He was a free spirit, and perhaps a little bit nuts. In 1972, Suzuki needed another adventure. He had returned to Japan  \fafter his travels and found the strict cultural norms and social hierarchy to be stifling. He hated school. He couldn\u2019t hold down a job. He wanted to be back on the road, back on his own again."}, {"text": " For Suzuki, the legend of Hiroo Onoda came as the answer to his problems. It was a new and worthy adventure for him to pursue. Suzuki believed that he would be the one who would find Onoda. Sure, search parties conducted by the Japanese, Philippine, and American governments had not been able to find Onoda; local police forces had been scavenging the jungle for almost thirty years with no luck; thousands of leaflets had met with no  \fresponse\u2014but fuck it, this deadbeat, college-dropout hippie was going to be the one to find him."}, {"text": " Unarmed and untrained for any sort of reconnaissance or tactical warfare, Suzuki traveled to Lubang and began wandering around the jungle all by himself. His strategy: scream Onoda\u2019s name really loudly and tell him that the emperor was worried about him. He found Onoda in four days. Suzuki stayed with Onoda in the jungle for some time."}, {"text": " Onoda had been alone by that point for over a year, and once found by Suzuki he welcomed the companionship and was desperate to learn what had been happening in the  \foutside world from a Japanese source he could trust. The two men became sortakinda friends. Suzuki asked Onoda why he had stayed and continued to fight."}, {"text": " Onoda said it was simple: he had been given the order to \u201cnever surrender,\u201d so he stayed. For nearly thirty years he had simply been following an order. Onoda then asked Suzuki why a \u201chippie boy\u201d like himself came looking for him. Suzuki said that he\u2019d left Japan in search of three things: \u201cLieutenant Onoda, a panda bear, and the Abominable Snowman, in that order."}, {"text": "\u201d The two men had been brought together under the most curious of  \fcircumstances: two well-intentioned adventurers chasing false visions of glory, like a real-life Japanese Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, stuck together in the damp recesses of a Philippine jungle, both imagining themselves heroes, despite both being alone with nothing, doing nothing."}, {"text": " Onoda had already by then given up most of his life to a phantom war. Suzuki would give his up too. Having already found Hiroo Onoda and the panda bear, he would die a few years later in the Himalayas, still in search of the Abominable Snowman. Humans often choose to dedicate large portions of their lives to seemingly useless or destructive causes."}, {"text": " On the  \fsurface, these causes make no sense. It\u2019s hard to imagine how Onoda could have been happy on that island for those thirty years\u2014living off insects and rodents, sleeping in the dirt, murdering civilians decade after decade. Or why Suzuki trekked off to his own death, with no money, no companions, and no purpose other than to chase an imaginary Yeti."}, {"text": " Yet, later in his life, Onoda said he regretted nothing. He claimed that he was proud of his choices and his time on Lubang. He said that it had been an honor to devote a sizable portion of his life in service to a nonexistent empire.

Hiroo Onoda chose to suffer for loyalty to a dead empire. Suzuki chose to suffer for adventure, no matter how ill-advised. To both men, their suffering meant something; it fulfilled some greater cause. And because it meant something, they were able to endure it, or perhaps even enjoy it."}, {"text": " If suffering is inevitable, if our problems in life are unavoidable, then the question we should be asking is not \u201cHow do I stop suffering?\u201d but \u201cWhy am I suffering\u2014for what purpose?\u201d  \fHiroo Onoda returned to Japan in 1974 and became a kind of celebrity in his home country. He was shuttled around from talk show to radio station; politicians clamored to shake his hand; he published a book and was even offered a large sum of money by the government."}, {"text": " But what he found when he returned to Japan horrified him: a consumerist, capitalist, superficial culture that had lost all of the traditions of honor and sacrifice upon which his generation had been raised. Onoda tried to use his sudden celebrity to espouse the values of Old Japan, but he was tone-deaf to this new  \fsociety."}, {"text": " He was seen more as a showpiece than as a serious cultural thinker\u2014a Japanese man who had emerged from a time capsule for all to marvel at, like a relic in a museum. And in the irony of ironies, Onoda became far more depressed than he\u2019d ever been in the jungle for all those years. At least in the jungle his life had stood for something; it had meant something."}, {"text": " That had made his suffering endurable, indeed even a little bit desirable. But back in Japan, in what he considered to be a vacuous nation full of hippies and loose women in Western clothing, he was confronted with the unavoidable truth: that his fighting had  \fmeant nothing. The Japan he had lived and fought for no longer existed."}, {"text": " And the weight of this realization pierced him in a way that no bullet ever had. Because his suffering had meant nothing, it suddenly became realized and true: thirty years wasted. And so, in 1980, Onoda packed up and moved to Brazil, where he remained until he died.  The Self-Awareness Onion Self-awareness is like an onion."}, {"text": " There are multiple layers to it, and the more you peel them back, the more likely you\u2019re going to start crying at inappropriate times.  \fLet\u2019s say the first layer of the selfawareness onion is a simple understanding of one\u2019s emotions. \u201cThis is when I feel happy.\u201d \u201cThis makes me feel sad."}, {"text": "\u201d \u201cThis gives me hope.\u201d Unfortunately, there are many people who suck at even this most basic level of self-awareness.

We all have emotional blind spots."}, {"text": " Often they have to do with the emotions that we were taught were inappropriate growing up. It takes years of practice and effort to get good at identifying blind spots in ourselves and then expressing the affected emotions appropriately. But this task is hugely important, and worth  \fthe effort. The second layer of the selfawareness onion is an ability to ask why we feel certain emotions."}, {"text": " These why questions are difficult and often take months or even years to answer consistently and accurately. Most people need to go to some sort of therapist just to hear these questions asked for the first time. Such questions are important because they illuminate what we consider success or failure."}, {"text": " Why do you feel angry? Is it because you failed to achieve some goal? Why do you feel lethargic and uninspired? Is it because you don\u2019t think you\u2019re good enough?  \fThis layer of questioning helps us understand the root cause of the emotions that overwhelm us. Once we understand that root cause, we can ideally do something to change it."}, {"text": " But there\u2019s another, even deeper level of the self-awareness onion. And that one is full of fucking tears. The third level is our personal values: Why do I consider this to be success/failure? How am I choosing to measure myself? By what standard am I judging myself and everyone around me? This level, which takes constant questioning and effort, is incredibly difficult to reach."}, {"text": " But it\u2019s the most important, because our values determine  \fthe nature of our problems, and the nature of our problems determines the quality of our lives. Values underlie everything we are and do.

But when they ask themselves why they feel lonely, they tend to come up with a way to blame others\u2014everyone else is mean, or no one is cool or smart enough to understand them\u2014and thus they further avoid their problem instead of seeking to solve it. For many people this passes as selfawareness."}, {"text": " And yet, if they were able to go deeper and look at their underlying values, they would see that their original  \fanalysis was based on avoiding responsibility for their own problem, rather than accurately identifying the problem. They would see that their decisions were based on chasing highs, not generating true happiness."}, {"text": " Most self-help gurus ignore this deeper level of self-awareness as well. They take people who are miserable because they want to be rich, and then give them all sorts of advice on how to make more money, all the while ignoring important values-based questions: Why do they feel such a need to be rich in the first place? How are they choosing to measure success/failure for themselves? Is it not perhaps some particular value  \fthat\u2019s the root cause of their unhappiness, and not the fact that they don\u2019t drive a Bentley yet? Much of the advice out there operates at a shallow level of simply trying to make people feel good in the short term, while the real long-term problems never get solved."}, {"text": " People\u2019s perceptions and feelings may change, but the underlying values, and the metrics by which those values are assessed, stay the same.

As he sat on the bus back to Los Angeles from New York, the guitarist kept asking himself: How did this happen? What did I do wrong? What will I do now?

And because of this, in a rare intimate interview in 2003, a tearful Mustaine admitted that he couldn\u2019t help but still consider himself a failure."}, {"text": " Despite all that he had accomplished, in his mind he would always be the guy who got kicked out of Metallica. We\u2019re apes. We think we\u2019re all  \fsophisticated with our toaster ovens and designer footwear, but we\u2019re just a bunch of finely ornamented apes. And because we are apes, we instinctually measure ourselves against others and vie for status."}, {"text": " The question is not whether we evaluate ourselves against others; rather, the question is by what standard do we measure ourselves? Dave Mustaine, whether he realized it or not, chose to measure himself by whether he was more successful and popular than Metallica.

If you want to change how you see your problems, you have to change what you value and/or how you measure failure/success."}, {"text": " As an example, let\u2019s look at another musician who got kicked out of another band. His story eerily echoes that of Dave Mustaine, although it happened two decades earlier.  \fIt was 1962 and there was a buzz around an up-and-coming band from Liverpool, England. This band had funny haircuts and an even funnier name, but their music was undeniably good, and the record industry was finally taking notice."}, {"text": " There was John, the lead singer and songwriter; Paul, the boyish-faced romantic bass player; George, the rebellious lead guitar player.

He didn\u2019t do drugs. He had a steady girlfriend. There were even a few people in suits and ties who thought he should be the face of the band, not John or Paul. His name was Pete Best. And in 1962, after landing their first record contract, the other three members of the Beatles quietly got together and asked their manager, Brian Epstein, to fire him."}, {"text": " Epstein agonized over the decision. He liked Pete, so he put it off, hoping the other three guys would change their minds. Months later, a mere three days before the recording of the first record began, Epstein finally called Best to his  \foffice. There, the manager unceremoniously told him to piss off and find another band."}, {"text": " He gave no reason, no explanation, no condolences\u2014just told him that the other guys wanted him out of the group, so, uh, best of luck. As a replacement, the band brought in some oddball named Ringo Starr. Ringo was older and had a big, funny nose. Ringo agreed to get the same ugly haircut as John, Paul, and George, and insisted on writing songs about octopuses and submarines."}, {"text": " The other guys said, Sure, fuck it, why not? Within six months of Best\u2019s firing, Beatlemania had erupted, making John, Paul, George, and Pete Ringo arguably  \ffour of the most famous faces on the entire planet. Meanwhile, Best understandably fell into a deep depression and spent a lot of time doing what any Englishman will do if you give him a reason to: drink."}, {"text": " The rest of the sixties were not kind to Pete Best. By 1965, he had sued two of the Beatles for slander, and all of his other musical projects had failed horribly. In 1968, he attempted suicide, only to be talked out of it by his mother. His life was a wreck. Best didn\u2019t have the same redemptive story Dave Mustaine did."}, {"text": " He never became a global superstar or made millions of dollars. Yet, in many  \fways, Best ended up better off than Mustaine. In an interview in 1994, Best said, \u201cI\u2019m happier than I would have been with the Beatles.\u201d What the hell? Best explained that the circumstances of his getting kicked out of the Beatles ultimately led him to meet his wife."}, {"text": " And then his marriage led him to having children. His values changed.

And yet, pleasure is what\u2019s marketed to us, twentyfour/seven. It\u2019s what we fixate on. It\u2019s what we use to numb and distract ourselves. But pleasure, while necessary in life (in certain doses), isn\u2019t, by itself, sufficient."}, {"text": " Pleasure is not the cause of happiness; rather, it is the effect. If you get the other stuff right (the other values and metrics), then pleasure will naturally occur as a by-product. Material Success. Many people  \fmeasure their self-worth based on how much money they make or what kind of car they drive or whether their front lawn is greener and prettier than the next-door neighbor\u2019s."}, {"text": " Research shows that once one is able to provide for basic physical needs (food, shelter, and so on), the correlation between happiness and worldly success quickly approaches zero.

The other issue with overvaluing material success is the danger of prioritizing it over other values, such as honesty, nonviolence, and compassion."}, {"text": " When people measure themselves not by their behavior, but by the status symbols they\u2019re able to collect, then not only are they shallow, but they\u2019re probably  \fassholes as well. 3.

We consistently make poor assumptions, misjudge probabilities, misremember facts, give in to cognitive biases, and make decisions based on our emotional whims."}, {"text": " As humans, we\u2019re wrong pretty much constantly, so if your metric for life success is to be right \u2014well, you\u2019re going to have a difficult time rationalizing all of the bullshit to yourself.

Really bad problems.  \fAlthough born into a wealthy and prominent family, from birth James suffered life-threatening health issues: an eye problem that left him temporarily blinded as a child; a terrible stomach condition that caused excessive vomiting and forced him to adopt an obscure and highly sensitive diet; trouble with his hearing; back spasms so bad that for days at a time he often couldn\u2019t sit or stand upright."}, {"text": " Due to his health problems, James spent most of his time at home. He didn\u2019t have many friends, and he wasn\u2019t particularly good at school. Instead, he passed the days painting. That was the only thing he liked and the only thing he  \ffelt particularly good at. Unfortunately, nobody else thought he was good at it."}, {"text": " When he grew to adulthood, nobody bought his work. And as the years dragged on, his father (a wealthy businessman) began ridiculing him for his laziness and his lack of talent. Meanwhile, his younger brother, Henry James, went on to become a world-renowned novelist; his sister, Alice James, made a good living as a writer as well."}, {"text": " William was the family oddball, the black sheep. In a desperate attempt to salvage the young man\u2019s future, James\u2019s father used his business connections to get him  \fadmitted into Harvard Medical School. It was his last chance, his father told him. If he screwed this up, there was no hope for him."}, {"text": " But James never felt at home or at peace at Harvard. Medicine never appealed to him. He spent the whole time feeling like a fake and a fraud. After all, if he couldn\u2019t overcome his own problems, how could he ever hope to have the energy to help others with theirs? After touring a psychiatric facility one day, James mused in his diary that he felt he had more in common with the patients than with the doctors."}, {"text": " A few years went by and, again to his father\u2019s disapproval, James dropped  \fout of medical school. But rather than deal with the brunt of his father\u2019s wrath, he decided to get away: he signed up to join an anthropological expedition to the Amazon rain forest. This was in the 1860s, so transcontinental travel was difficult and dangerous."}, {"text": " If you ever played the computer game Oregon Trail when you were a kid, it was kind of like that, with the dysentery and drowning oxen and everything. Anyway, James made it all the way to the Amazon, where the real adventure was to begin. Surprisingly, his fragile health held up that whole way. But once he finally made it, on the first day of the  \fexpedition, he promptly contracted smallpox and nearly died in the jungle."}, {"text": " Then his back spasms returned, painful to the point of making James unable to walk. By this time, he was emaciated and starved from the smallpox, immobilized by his bad back, and left alone in the middle of South America (the rest of the expedition having gone on without him) with no clear way to get home\u2014a journey that would take months and likely kill him anyway."}, {"text": " But somehow he eventually made it back to New England, where he was greeted by an (even more) disappointed father. By this point the young man  \fwasn\u2019t so young anymore\u2014nearly thirty years old, still unemployed, a failure at everything he had attempted, with a body that routinely betrayed him and wasn\u2019t likely to ever get better."}, {"text": " Despite all the advantages and opportunities he\u2019d been given in life, everything had fallen apart. The only constants in his life seemed to be suffering and disappointment. James fell into a deep depression and began making plans to take his own life. But one night, while reading lectures by the philosopher Charles Peirce, James decided to conduct a little experiment."}, {"text": " In his diary, he wrote that he would spend one year believing that he was 100 percent responsible for  \feverything that occurred in his life, no matter what. During this period, he would do everything in his power to change his circumstances, no matter the likelihood of failure. If nothing improved in that year, then it would be apparent that he was truly powerless to the circumstances around him, and then he would take his own life."}, {"text": " The punch line? William James went on to become the father of American psychology. His work has been translated into a bazillion languages, and he\u2019s regarded as one of the most influential intellectuals/philosophers/psychologists of his generation. He would go on to  \fteach at Harvard and would tour much of the United States and Europe giving lectures."}, {"text": " He would marry and have five children (one of whom, Henry, would become a famous biographer and win a Pulitzer Prize).

We are always interpreting the meaning of every moment and every occurrence. We are always choosing the values by which we live and the metrics by which we measure everything that happens to us."}, {"text": " Often the same event can be good or bad, depending on the metric we choose to use. The point is, we are always choosing, whether we recognize it or not. Always. It comes back to how, in reality, there is no such thing as not giving a single fuck. It\u2019s impossible. We must all give a fuck about something."}, {"text": " To not give a fuck about anything is still to give a  \ffuck about something. The real question is, What are we choosing to give a fuck about?

The few times he did, he would home in on the smallest behaviors from any woman he talked with that could possibly indicate he wasn\u2019t  \fattractive enough for her and then convince himself that she didn\u2019t like him, even if she really did."}, {"text": " As you can imagine, his dating life sucked. What he didn\u2019t realize was that he had chosen the value that was hurting him: height. Women, he assumed, are attracted only to height. He was screwed, no matter what he did.

In fact, I had often been cold and arrogant toward her; other times I took her for granted and blew her off and hurt her."}, {"text": " These things were my fault too. Did my mistakes justify her mistake? No. But still, I took on the responsibility  \fof never making those same mistakes again, and never overlooking the same signs again, to help guarantee that I will never suffer the same consequences again.

No more cheating girlfriends leaving me, no more 253 stomach punches. I took responsibility for my problems and improved upon them.

What that means, as one example, is that when Imogen becomes flooded with horrible thoughts of her family dying, she is to accept that her family may actually die and that there\u2019s nothing she can do about it; simply put, she is told that what happens to her is not her fault."}, {"text": " Josh is forced to accept that over the long term, \u201cequalizing\u201d all of his behaviors to make them symmetrical is actually destroying his life more than occasional panic attacks would. And Jack is reminded that no matter what he does, germs are always present and always infecting  \fhim. The goal is to get the kids to recognize that their values are not rational\u2014that in fact their values are not even theirs, but rather are the disorder\u2019s \u2014and that by fulfilling these irrational values they are actually harming their ability to function in life."}, {"text": " The next step is to encourage the kids to choose a value that is more important than their OCD value and to focus on that. For Josh, it\u2019s the possibility of not having to hide his disorder from his friends and family all the time, the prospect of having a normal, functioning social life.

Her partner also used her traumatic past as a weapon of guilt to earn Meredith\u2019s affection (more on this and boundaries in chapter 8)."}, {"text": " Meanwhile, Meredith\u2019s relationship with her father deteriorated even further  \f(he wasn\u2019t exactly thrilled that she was now in a lesbian relationship), and she was attending therapy at an almost compulsive rate. Her therapists, who had their own values and beliefs driving their behavior, regularly insisted that it couldn\u2019t simply be Meredith\u2019s highly stressful reporting job or her poor relationships that were making her so unhappy; it must be something else, something deeper."}, {"text": " Around this time, a new form of treatment called repressed memory therapy was becoming hugely popular. This therapy involved a therapist putting a client into a trancelike state where she was encouraged to root out and  \freexperience forgotten childhood memories. These memories were often benign, but the idea was that at least a few of them would be traumatic as well."}, {"text": " So there you have poor Meredith, miserable and researching incest and child molestation every day, angry at her father, having endured an entire lifetime of failed relationships with men, and the only person who seems to understand her or love her is another woman who is a survivor of incest. Oh, and she\u2019s lying on a couch crying every other day with a therapist demanding over and over that she remember something she can\u2019t remember."}, {"text": " And voil\u00e0, you have a perfect recipe for an invented memory of sexual  \fabuse that never happened. Our mind\u2019s biggest priority when processing experiences is to interpret them in such a way that they will cohere with all of our previous experiences, feelings, and beliefs. But often we run into life situations where past and present don\u2019t cohere: on such occasions, what we\u2019re experiencing in the moment flies in the face of everything we\u2019ve accepted as true and reasonable about our past."}, {"text": " In an effort to achieve coherence, our mind will sometimes, in cases like that, invent false memories. By linking our present experiences with that imagined past, our mind allows us to maintain whatever meaning we already  \festablished. As noted earlier, Meredith\u2019s story is not unique. In fact, in the 1980s and early 1990s, hundreds of innocent people were wrongly accused of sexual violence under similar circumstances."}, {"text": " Many of them went to prison for it. For people who were dissatisfied with their lives, these suggestive explanations, combined with the sensationalizing media\u2014there were veritable epidemics of sexual abuse and satanic violence going on, and you could be a victim too\u2014gave people\u2019s unconscious minds the incentive to fudge their memories a bit and explain their current suffering in a way that allowed  \fthem to be victims and avoid responsibility."}, {"text": " Repressed memory therapy then acted as a means to pull these unconscious desires out and put them into a seemingly tangible form of a memory. This process, and the state of mind it resulted in, became so common that a name was introduced for it: false memory syndrome. It changed the way courtrooms operate."}, {"text": " Thousands of therapists were sued and lost their licenses. Repressed memory therapy fell out of practice and was replaced by more practical methods. Recent research has only reinforced the painful lesson of that era: our beliefs are malleable, and  \four memories are horribly unreliable. There\u2019s a lot of conventional wisdom out there telling you to \u201ctrust yourself,\u201d to \u201cgo with your gut,\u201d and all sorts of other pleasant-sounding clich\u00e9s."}, {"text": " But perhaps the answer is to trust yourself less. After all, if our hearts and minds are so unreliable, maybe we should be questioning our own intentions and motivations more. If we\u2019re all wrong, all the time, then isn\u2019t selfskepticism and the rigorous challenging of our own beliefs and assumptions the only logical route to progress? This may sound scary and selfdestructive."}, {"text": " But it\u2019s actually quite the opposite. It\u2019s not only the safer option,  \fbut it\u2019s liberating as well.  The Dangers Certainty  of  Pure  Erin sits across from me at the sushi restaurant and tries to explain why she doesn\u2019t believe in death.

It\u2019s four o\u2019clock on a Tuesday afternoon. I didn\u2019t invite her here. She found out where I was via the Internet and flew out to come find me. Again.  \fShe\u2019s done this before. You see, Erin is convinced that she can cure death, but she\u2019s also convinced that she needs my help to do it."}, {"text": " But not my help in like a business sense. If she just needed some PR advice or something, that would be one thing. No, it\u2019s more than that: she needs me to be her boyfriend. Why? After three hours of questioning and a bottle and a half of sake, it still isn\u2019t clear. My fianc\u00e9e was with us in the restaurant, by the way."}, {"text": " Erin thought it important that she be included in the discussion; Erin wanted her to know that she was \u201cwilling to share\u201d me and that my girlfriend (now wife) \u201cshouldn\u2019t feel  \fthreatened\u201d by her. I met Erin at a self-help seminar in 2008. She seemed like a nice enough person. A little bit on the woo-woo, New Agey side of things, but she was a lawyer and had gone to an Ivy League school, and was clearly smart."}, {"text": " And she laughed at my jokes and thought I was cute\u2014so, of course, knowing me, I slept with her. A month later, she invited me to uproot across the country and move in with her. This struck me as somewhat of a red flag, and so I tried to break things off with her. She responded by saying that she would kill herself if I refused to be with her."}, {"text": " Okay, so make that two red  \fflags. I promptly blocked her from my email and all my devices. This would slow her down but not stop her. Years before I met her, Erin had gotten into a car accident and nearly died. Actually, she had medically \u201cdied\u201d for a few moments\u2014all brain activity had stopped\u2014but she had somehow miraculously been revived."}, {"text": " When she \u201ccame back,\u201d she claimed everything had changed. She became a very spiritual person. She became interested in, and started believing in, energy healing and angels and universal consciousness and tarot cards. She also believed that she had become a healer  \fand an empath and that she could see the future."}, {"text": " And for whatever reason, upon meeting me, she decided that she and I were destined to save the world together. To \u201ccure death,\u201d as she put it. After I\u2019d blocked her, she began to create new email addresses, sometimes sending me as many as a dozen angry emails in a single day. She created fake Facebook and Twitter accounts that she used to harass me as well as people close to me."}, {"text": " She created a website identical to mine and wrote dozens of articles claiming that I was her exboyfriend and that I had lied to her and cheated her, that I had promised to marry her and that she and I belonged together.  \fWhen I contacted her to take the site down, she said that she would take it down only if I flew to California to be with her."}, {"text": " This was her idea of a compromise. And through all of this, her justification was the same: I was destined to be with her, that God had preordained it, that she literally woke up in the middle of the night to the voices of angels commanding that \u201cour special relationship\u201d was to be the harbinger of a new age of permanent peace on earth."}, {"text": " (Yes, she really told me this.) By the time we were sitting in that sushi restaurant together, there had been thousands of emails. Whether I  \fresponded or didn\u2019t respond, replied respectfully or replied angrily, nothing ever changed. Her mind never changed; her beliefs never budged. This had gone on for over seven years by then (and counting)."}, {"text": " And so it was, in that small sushi restaurant, with Erin guzzling sake and babbling for hours about how she\u2019d cured her cat\u2019s kidney stones with energy tapping, that something occurred to me: Erin is a self-improvement junkie. She spends tens of thousands of dollars on books and seminars and courses."}, {"text": " And the craziest part of all this is that Erin embodies all the lessons she\u2019s learned to  \fa T. She has her dream. She stays persistent with it. She visualizes and takes action and weathers the rejections and failures and gets up and tries again. She\u2019s relentlessly positive. She thinks pretty damn highly of herself."}, {"text": " I mean, she claims to heal cats the same way Jesus healed Lazarus\u2014come the fuck on. And yet her values are so fucked that none of this matters. The fact that she does everything \u201cright\u201d doesn\u2019t make her right. There is a certainty in her that refuses to relinquish itself. She has even told me this in so many words: that she knows her fixation is completely irrational and unhealthy and is making  \fboth her and me unhappy."}, {"text": " But for some reason it feels so right to her that she can\u2019t ignore it and she can\u2019t stop. In the mid-1990s, psychologist Roy Baumeister began researching the concept of evil. Basically, he looked at people who do bad things and at why they do them. At the time it was assumed that people did bad things because they felt horrible about themselves\u2014that is, they had low self-esteem."}, {"text": " One of Baumeister\u2019s first surprising findings was that this was often not true. In fact, it was usually the opposite. Some of the worst criminals felt pretty damn good about themselves. And it was this feeling  \fgood about themselves in spite of the reality around them that gave them the sense of justification for hurting and disrespecting others."}, {"text": " For individuals to feel justified in doing horrible things to other people, they must feel an unwavering certainty in their own righteousness, in their own beliefs and deservedness. Racists do racist things because they\u2019re certain about their genetic superiority. Religious fanatics blow themselves up and murder dozens of people because they\u2019re certain of their place in heaven as martyrs."}, {"text": " Men rape and abuse women out of their certainty that they\u2019re entitled to women\u2019s bodies.  \fEvil people never believe that they are evil; rather, they believe that everyone else is evil. In controversial experiments, now simply known as the Milgram Experiments, named for the psychologist Stanley Milgram, researchers told \u201cnormal\u201d people that they were to punish other volunteers for breaking various rules."}, {"text": " And punish them they did, sometimes escalating the punishment to the point of physical abuse. Almost none of the punishers objected or asked for explanation. On the contrary, many of them seemed to relish the certainty of the moral righteousness bestowed upon them by the experiments.  \fThe problem here is that not only is certainty unattainable, but the pursuit of certainty often breeds more (and worse) insecurity."}, {"text": " Many people have an unshakable certainty in their ability at their job or in the amount of salary they should be making. But that certainty makes them feel worse, not better. They see others getting promoted over them, and they feel slighted. They feel unappreciated and underacknowledged. Even a behavior as simple as sneaking a peek at your boyfriend\u2019s text messages or asking a friend what people are saying about you is driven by insecurity and that aching desire to be  \fcertain."}, {"text": " You can check your boyfriend\u2019s text messages and find nothing, but that\u2019s rarely the end of it; then you may start wondering if he has a second phone. You can feel slighted and stepped over at work to explain why you missed out on a promotion, but then that causes you to distrust your coworkers and secondguess everything they say to you (and how you think they feel about you), which in turn makes you even less likely to get promoted."}, {"text": " You can keep pursuing that special someone you\u2019re \u201csupposed\u201d to be with, but with each rebuffed advance and each lonely night, you only begin to question more and more what  \fyou\u2019re doing wrong. And it\u2019s in these moments of insecurity, of deep despair, that we become susceptible to an insidious entitlement: believing that we deserve to cheat a little to get our way, that other people deserve to be punished, that we deserve to take what we want, and sometimes violently."}, {"text": " It\u2019s the backwards law again: the more you try to be certain about something, the more uncertain and insecure you will feel. But the converse is true as well: the more you embrace being uncertain and not knowing, the more comfortable you will feel in knowing what you don\u2019t  \fknow. Uncertainty removes our judgments of others; it preempts the unnecessary stereotyping and biases that we otherwise feel when we see somebody on TV, in the office, or on the street."}, {"text": " Uncertainty also relieves us of our judgment of ourselves. We don\u2019t know if we\u2019re lovable or not; we don\u2019t know how attractive we are; we don\u2019t know how successful we could potentially become. The only way to achieve these things is to remain uncertain of them and be open to finding them out through experience."}, {"text": " Uncertainty is the root of all progress and all growth. As the old  \fadage goes, the man who believes he knows everything learns nothing. We cannot learn anything without first not knowing something. The more we admit we do not know, the more opportunities we gain to learn. Our values are imperfect and incomplete, and to assume that they are perfect and complete is to put us in a dangerously dogmatic mindset that breeds entitlement and avoids responsibility."}, {"text": " The only way to solve our problems is to first admit that our actions and beliefs up to this point have been wrong and are not working. This openness to being wrong must exist for any real change or growth to  \ftake place. Before we can look at our values and prioritizations and change them into better, healthier ones, we must first become uncertain of our current values."}, {"text": " We must intellectually strip them away, see their faults and biases, see how they don\u2019t fit in with much of the rest of the world, to stare our own ignorance in the face and concede, because our own ignorance is greater than us all.

I graduated college in 2007, just in time for the financial collapse and Great Recession, and attempted to enter the worst job market in more than eighty years. Around the same time, I found out  \fthat the person who was subletting one of the rooms in my apartment hadn\u2019t paid any rent for three months."}, {"text": " When confronted about this, she cried and then disappeared, leaving my other roommate and me to cover everything.

So yeah, lucky.

So why not try? Failure itself is a relative concept. If my metric had been to become an anarcho-communist revolutionary, then  \fmy complete failure to make any money between 2007 and 2008 would have been a raving success."}, {"text": " But if, like most people, my metric had been to simply find a first serious job that could pay some bills right out of school, I was a dismal failure. I grew up in a wealthy family. Money was never a problem. On the contrary, I grew up in a wealthy family where money was more often used to avoid problems than solve them."}, {"text": " I was again fortunate, because this taught me at an early age that making money, by itself, was a lousy metric for myself. You could make plenty of money and be miserable, just as you could be broke and be pretty  \fhappy. Therefore, why use money as a means to measure my self-worth? Instead, my value was something else."}, {"text": " It was freedom, autonomy. The idea of being an entrepreneur had always appealed to me because I hated being told what to do and preferred to do things my way. The idea of working on the Internet appealed to me because I could do it from anywhere and work whenever I wanted. I asked myself a simple question: \u201cWould I rather make decent money and work a job I hated, or play at Internet entrepreneur and be broke for a while?\u201d The answer was immediate and clear for me: the latter."}, {"text": " I then asked myself, \u201cIf I  \ftry this thing and fail in a few years and have to go get a job anyway, will I have really lost anything?\u201d The answer was no.

With this value, to not pursue my own projects became the failure\u2014not a lack of money, not sleeping on friends\u2019 and family\u2019s couches (which I continued to do for most of the next two years), and not an empty r\u00e9sum\u00e9.  The Paradox  Failure/Success  \fWhen Pablo Picasso was an old man, he was sitting in a caf\u00e9 in Spain, doodling on a used napkin."}, {"text": " He was nonchalant about the whole thing, drawing whatever amused him in that moment\u2014kind of the same way teenage boys draw penises on bathroom stalls\u2014except this was Picasso, so his bathroom-stall penises were more like cubist/impressionist awesomeness laced on top of faint coffee stains. Anyway, some woman sitting near him was looking on in awe."}, {"text": " After a few moments, Picasso finished his coffee and crumpled up the napkin to throw away as he left. The woman stopped him. \u201cWait,\u201d she  \fsaid. \u201cCan I have that napkin you were just drawing on? I\u2019ll pay you for it.\u201d \u201cSure,\u201d Picasso replied. \u201cTwenty thousand dollars.\u201d The woman\u2019s head jolted back as if he had just flung a brick at her."}, {"text": " \u201cWhat? It took you like two minutes to draw that.\u201d \u201cNo, ma\u2019am,\u201d Picasso said. \u201cIt took me over sixty years to draw this.\u201d He stuffed the napkin in his pocket and walked out of the caf\u00e9. Improvement at anything is based on thousands of tiny failures, and the magnitude of your success is based on how many times you\u2019ve failed at something."}, {"text": " If someone is better than you at something, then it\u2019s likely because she  \fhas failed at it more than you have. If someone is worse than you, it\u2019s likely because he hasn\u2019t been through all of the painful learning experiences you have. If you think about a young child trying to learn to walk, that child will fall down and hurt itself hundreds of times."}, {"text": " But at no point does that child ever stop and think, \u201cOh, I guess walking just isn\u2019t for me. I\u2019m not good at it.\u201d Avoiding failure is something we learn at some later point in life. I\u2019m sure a lot of it comes from our education system, which judges rigorously based on performance and punishes those who don\u2019t do well."}, {"text": " Another large share of it comes from overbearing or critical  \fparents who don\u2019t let their kids screw up on their own often enough, and instead punish them for trying anything new or not preordained. And then we have all the mass media that constantly expose us to stellar success after success, while not showing us the thousands of hours of dull practice and tedium that were required to achieve that success."}, {"text": " At some point, most of us reach a place where we\u2019re afraid to fail, where we instinctively avoid failure and stick only to what is placed in front of us or only what we\u2019re already good at. This confines us and stifles us. We can be truly successful only at something we\u2019re willing to fail at. If we\u2019re  \funwilling to fail, then we\u2019re unwilling to succeed."}, {"text": " A lot of this fear of failure comes from having chosen shitty values. For instance, if I measure myself by the standard \u201cMake everyone I meet like me,\u201d I will be anxious, because failure is 100 percent defined by the actions of others, not by my own actions. I am not in control; thus my self-worth is at the mercy of judgments by others."}, {"text": " Whereas if I instead adopt the metric \u201cImprove my social life,\u201d I can live up to my value of \u201cgood relations with others\u201d regardless of how other people respond to me. My self-worth is based on my own behaviors and happiness.  \fShitty values, as we saw in chapter 4, involve tangible external goals outside of our control."}, {"text": " The pursuit of these goals causes great anxiety. And even if we manage to achieve them, they leave us feeling empty and lifeless, because once they\u2019re achieved there are no more problems to solve. Better values, as we saw, are process-oriented. Something like \u201cExpress myself honestly to others,\u201d a metric for the value \u201chonesty,\u201d is never completely finished; it\u2019s a problem that must continuously be reengaged."}, {"text": " Every new conversation, every new relationship, brings new challenges and opportunities for honest expression. The  \fvalue is an ongoing, lifelong process that defies completion. If your metric for the value \u201csuccess by worldly standards\u201d is \u201cBuy a house and a nice car,\u201d and you spend twenty years working your ass off to achieve it, once it\u2019s achieved the metric has nothing left to give you."}, {"text": " Then say hello to your midlife crisis, because the problem that drove you your entire adult life was just taken away from you. There are no other opportunities to keep growing and improving, and yet it\u2019s growth that generates happiness, not a long list of arbitrary achievements. In this sense, goals, as they are conventionally defined\u2014graduate from  \fcollege, buy a lake house, lose fifteen pounds\u2014are limited in the amount of happiness they can produce in our lives."}, {"text": " They may be helpful when pursuing quick, short-term benefits, but as guides for the overall trajectory of our life, they suck. Picasso remained prolific his entire life. He lived into his nineties and continued to produce art up until his final years. Had his metric been \u201cBecome famous\u201d or \u201cMake a buttload of money in the art world\u201d or \u201cPaint one thousand pictures,\u201d he would have stagnated at some point along the way."}, {"text": " He would have been overcome by anxiety or self-doubt. He likely wouldn\u2019t  \fhave improved and innovated his craft in the ways he did decade after decade. The reason for Picasso\u2019s success is exactly the same reason why, as an old man, he was happy to scribble drawings on a napkin alone in a caf\u00e9."}, {"text": " His underlying value was simple and humble. And it was endless. It was the value \u201chonest expression.\u201d And this is what made that napkin so valuable.  Pain Is Part of the Process In the 1950s, a Polish psychologist named Kazimierz Dabrowski studied World War II survivors and how they\u2019d coped with traumatic experiences in the war."}, {"text": " This was Poland, so things had  \fbeen pretty gruesome. These people had experienced or witnessed mass starvation, bombings that turned cities to rubble, the Holocaust, the torture of prisoners of war, and the rape and/or murder of family members, if not by the Nazis, then a few years later by the Soviets."}, {"text": " As Dabrowski studied the survivors, he noticed something both surprising and amazing. A sizable percentage of them believed that the wartime experiences they\u2019d suffered, although painful and indeed traumatic, had actually caused them to become better, more responsible, and yes, even happier people."}, {"text": " Many described their lives  \fbefore the war as if they\u2019d been different people then: ungrateful for and unappreciative of their loved ones, lazy and consumed by petty problems, entitled to all they\u2019d been given. After the war they felt more confident, more sure of themselves, more grateful, and unfazed by life\u2019s trivialities and petty annoyances."}, {"text": " Obviously, their experiences had been horrific, and these survivors weren\u2019t happy about having had to experience them. Many of them still suffered from the emotional scars the lashings of war had left on them. But some of them had managed to leverage those scars to transform themselves in  \fpositive and powerful ways."}, {"text": " And they aren\u2019t alone in that reversal. For many of us, our proudest achievements come in the face of the greatest adversity. Our pain often makes us stronger, more resilient, more grounded. Many cancer survivors, for example, report feeling stronger and more grateful after winning their battle to survive."}, {"text": " Many military personnel report a mental resilience gained from withstanding the dangerous environments of being in a war zone. Dabrowski argued that fear and anxiety and sadness are not necessarily always undesirable or unhelpful states of mind; rather, they are often  \frepresentative of the necessary pain of psychological growth."}, {"text": " And to deny that pain is to deny our own potential. Just as one must suffer physical pain to build stronger bone and muscle, one must suffer emotional pain to develop greater emotional resilience, a stronger sense of self, increased compassion, and a generally happier life. Our most radical changes in perspective often happen at the tail end of our worst moments."}, {"text": " It\u2019s only when we feel intense pain that we\u2019re willing to look at our values and question why they seem to be failing us. We need some sort of existential crisis to take an objective look at how we\u2019ve been deriving  \fmeaning in our life, and then consider changing course. You could call it \u201chitting bottom\u201d or \u201chaving an existential crisis."}, {"text": "\u201d I prefer to call it \u201cweathering the shitstorm.\u201d Choose what suits you.

I can\u2019t stress this enough, but pain is part of the process. It\u2019s important to feel it. Because if you just chase after highs to  \fcover up the pain, if you continue to indulge in entitlement and delusional positive thinking, if you continue to overindulge in various substances or activities, then you\u2019ll never generate the requisite motivation to actually change."}, {"text": " When I was young, any time my family got a new VCR or stereo, I would press every button, plug and unplug every cord and cable, just to see what everything did. With time, I learned how the whole system worked. And because I knew how it all worked, I was often the only person in the house who used the stuff."}, {"text": " As is the case for many millennial children, my parents looked on as if I  \fwere some sort of prodigy. To them, the fact that I could program the VCR without looking at the instruction manual made me the Second Coming of Tesla. It\u2019s easy to look back at my parents\u2019 generation and chuckle at their technophobia."}, {"text": " But the further I get into adulthood, the more I realize that we all have areas of our lives where we\u2019re like my parents with the new VCR: we sit and stare and shake our heads and say, \u201cBut how?\u201d When really, it\u2019s as simple as just doing it. I get emails from people asking questions like this all the time."}, {"text": " And for many years, I never knew what to say to them.  \fThere\u2019s the girl whose parents are immigrants and saved for their whole lives to put her through med school.

So he agonizes over every sign, every laugh, every smile, every diversion into small talk, and emails me a twenty-eight-page novella that concludes with the question, \u201cHow do I  \fask her out?\u201d Or the single mother whose now-adult kids have finished school and are loafing around on her couch, eating her food, spending her money, not respecting her space or her desire for privacy."}, {"text": " She wants them to move on with their lives. She wants to move on with her life. Yet she\u2019s scared to death of pushing her children away, scared to the point of asking, \u201cHow do I ask them to move out?\u201d These are VCR questions.

The problem here is pain. Filling out the appropriate paperwork to drop out of med school is a straightforward and obvious action; breaking your parents\u2019 hearts is not. Asking a tutor out on a date is as simple as saying the words; risking intense embarrassment and rejection feels far more complicated."}, {"text": " Asking someone to move out of your house is a clear decision; feeling as if you\u2019re  \fabandoning your own children is not.

How can somebody do that?\u201d  \fI had all sorts of screwed-up beliefs about this, like that you weren\u2019t allowed to speak to someone unless you had some practical reason to, or that women would think I was a creepy rapist if I so much as said, \u201cHello."}, {"text": "\u201d The problem was that my emotions defined my reality.

When I was in high school, my math teacher Mr. Packwood used to say, \u201cIf you\u2019re stuck on a problem, don\u2019t sit there and think about it; just start working on it.

The answers will follow."}, {"text": " In the course of applying Mr. Packwood\u2019s advice, I learned a powerful lesson about motivation. It took about eight years for this lesson to sink in, but what I discovered, over those long, grueling months of bombed product launches, laughable advice columns, uncomfortable nights on friends\u2019 couches, overdrawn bank accounts, and hundreds of thousands of words written (most of them unread), was perhaps the most important thing  \fI\u2019ve ever learned in my life: Action isn\u2019t just the effect of motivation; it\u2019s also the cause of it."}, {"text": " Most of us commit to action only if we feel a certain level of motivation.

Some of my greatest life lessons and characterdefining moments came on the road during this period. But some of the biggest wastes of my time and energy came during this period as well. Now I live in New York. I have a house and furniture and an electric bill and a wife."}, {"text": " None of it is particularly  \fglamorous or exciting. And I like it that way. Because after all the years of excitement, the biggest lesson I took from my adventuring was this: absolute freedom, by itself, means nothing. Freedom grants the opportunity for greater meaning, but by itself there is nothing necessarily meaningful about it."}, {"text": " Ultimately, the only way to achieve meaning and a sense of importance in one\u2019s life is through a rejection of alternatives, a narrowing of freedom, a choice of commitment to one place, one belief, or (gulp) one person. This realization came to me slowly over the course of my years traveling. As with most excesses in life, you have  \fto drown yourself in them to realize that they don\u2019t make you happy."}, {"text": " Such was traveling with me. As I drowned in my fifty-third, fifty-fourth, fifty-fifth country, I began to understand that while all of my experiences were exciting and great, few of them would have any lasting significance. Whereas my friends back home were settling down into marriages, buying houses, and giving their time to interesting companies or political causes, I was floundering from one high to the next."}, {"text": " In 2011, I traveled to Saint Petersburg, Russia. The food sucked. The weather sucked. (Snow in May? Are you fucking kidding me?) My apartment  \fsucked. Nothing worked. Everything was overpriced. The people were rude and smelled funny. Nobody smiled and everyone drank too much. Yet, I loved it. It was one of my favorite trips."}, {"text": " There\u2019s a bluntness to Russian culture that generally rubs Westerners the wrong way. Gone are the fake niceties and verbal webs of politeness. You don\u2019t smile at strangers or pretend to like anything you don\u2019t. In Russia, if something is stupid, you say it\u2019s stupid. If someone is being an asshole, you tell him he\u2019s being an asshole."}, {"text": " If you really like someone and are having a great time, you tell her that you like her and are having a great time. It doesn\u2019t matter  \fif this person is your friend, a stranger, or someone you met five minutes ago on the street. The first week I found all of this really uncomfortable. I went on a coffee date with a Russian girl, and within three minutes of sitting down she looked at me funny and told me that what I\u2019d just said was stupid."}, {"text": " I nearly choked on my drink. There was nothing combative about the way she said it; it was spoken as if it were some mundane fact\u2014like the quality of the weather that day, or her shoe size\u2014but I was still shocked. After all, in the West such outspokenness is seen as highly offensive, especially from someone you just met."}, {"text": " But it went on like  \fthis with everyone. Everyone came across as rude all the time, and as a result, my Western-coddled mind felt attacked on all sides. Nagging insecurities began to surface in situations where they hadn\u2019t existed in years. But as the weeks wore on, I got used to the Russian frankness, much as I did the midnight sunsets and the vodka that went down like ice water."}, {"text": " And then I started appreciating it for what it really was: unadulterated expression. Honesty in the truest sense of the word. Communication with no conditions, no strings attached, no ulterior motive, no sales job, no desperate attempt to be  \fliked. Somehow, after years of travel, it was in perhaps the most un-American of places where I first experienced a particular flavor of freedom: the ability to say whatever I thought or felt, without fear of repercussion."}, {"text": " It was a strange form of liberation through accepting rejection. And as someone who had been starved of this kind of blunt expression most of his life\u2014first by an emotionally repressed family life, then later by a meticulously constructed false display of confidence\u2014I got drunk on it like, well, like it was the finest damn vodka I\u2019d ever had."}, {"text": " The month I spent in Saint Petersburg went by in a blur, and by the  \fend I didn\u2019t want to leave. Travel is a fantastic selfdevelopment tool, because it extricates you from the values of your culture and shows you that another society can live with entirely different values and still function and not hate themselves."}, {"text": " This exposure to different cultural values and metrics then forces you to reexamine what seems obvious in your own life and to consider that perhaps it\u2019s not necessarily the best way to live. In this case, Russia had me reexamining the bullshitty, fake-nice communication that is so common in Anglo culture, and asking myself if this wasn\u2019t somehow making us more insecure around each  \fother and worse at intimacy."}, {"text": " I remember discussing this dynamic with my Russian teacher one day, and he had an interesting theory. Having lived under communism for so many generations, with little to no economic opportunity and caged by a culture of fear, Russian society found the most valuable currency to be trust. And to build trust you have to be honest."}, {"text": " That means when things suck, you say so openly and without apology. People\u2019s displays of unpleasant honesty were rewarded for the simple fact that they were necessary for survival\u2014you had to know whom you could rely on and whom you couldn\u2019t, and you needed to  \fknow quickly. But, in the \u201cfree\u201d West, my Russian teacher continued, there existed an abundance of economic opportunity\u2014so much economic opportunity that it became far more valuable to present yourself in a certain way, even if it was false, than to actually be that way."}, {"text": " Trust lost its value. Appearances and salesmanship became more advantageous forms of expression. Knowing a lot of people superficially was more beneficial than knowing a few people closely. This is why it became the norm in Western cultures to smile and say polite things even when you don\u2019t feel like it,  \fto tell little white lies and agree with someone whom you don\u2019t actually agree with."}, {"text": " This is why people learn to pretend to be friends with people they don\u2019t actually like, to buy things they don\u2019t actually want. The economic system promotes such deception. The downside of this is that you never know, in the West, if you can completely trust the person you\u2019re talking to. Sometimes this is the case even among good friends or family members."}, {"text": " There is such pressure in the West to be likable that people often reconfigure their entire personality depending on the person they\u2019re dealing with.  \fRejection Makes Your Life Better As an extension of our positivity/consumer culture, many of us have been \u201cindoctrinated\u201d with the belief that we should try to be as inherently accepting and affirmative as possible."}, {"text": " This is a cornerstone of many of the so-called positive thinking books: open yourself up to opportunities, be accepting, say yes to everything and everyone, and so on. But we need to reject something. Otherwise, we stand for nothing. If nothing is better or more desirable than anything else, then we are empty and our life is meaningless."}, {"text": " We are without  \fvalues and therefore live our life without any purpose. The avoidance of rejection (both giving and receiving it) is often sold to us as a way to make ourselves feel better. But avoiding rejection gives us short-term pleasure by making us rudderless and directionless in the long term."}, {"text": " To truly appreciate something, you must confine yourself to it. There\u2019s a certain level of joy and meaning that you reach in life only when you\u2019ve spent decades investing in a single relationship, a single craft, a single career. And you cannot achieve those decades of investment without rejecting  \fthe alternatives."}, {"text": " The act of choosing a value for yourself requires rejecting alternative values. If I choose to make my marriage the most important part of my life, that means I\u2019m (probably) choosing not to make cocaine-fueled hooker orgies an important part of my life. If I\u2019m choosing to judge myself based on my ability to have open and accepting friendships, that means I\u2019m rejecting trashing my friends behind their backs."}, {"text": " These are all healthy decisions, yet they require rejection at every turn. The point is this: we all must give a fuck about something, in order to value something. And to value something, we  \fmust reject what is not that something. To value X, we must reject non-X. That rejection is an inherent and necessary part of maintaining our values, and therefore our identity."}, {"text": " We are defined by what we choose to reject. And if we reject nothing (perhaps in fear of being rejected by something ourselves), we essentially have no identity at all. The desire to avoid rejection at all costs, to avoid confrontation and conflict, the desire to attempt to accept everything equally and to make everything cohere and harmonize, is a deep and subtle form of entitlement."}, {"text": " Entitled people, because they feel as  \fthough they deserve to feel great all the time, avoid rejecting anything because doing so might make them or someone else feel bad. And because they refuse to reject anything, they live a valueless, pleasure-driven, and self-absorbed life. All they give a fuck about is sustaining the high a little bit longer, to avoid the inevitable failures of their life, to pretend the suffering away."}, {"text": " Rejection is an important and crucial life skill. Nobody wants to be stuck in a relationship that isn\u2019t making them happy. Nobody wants to be stuck in a business doing work they hate and don\u2019t believe in. Nobody wants to feel that they can\u2019t say what they really mean.  \fYet people choose these things."}, {"text": " All the time. Honesty is a natural human craving. But part of having honesty in our lives is becoming comfortable with saying and hearing the word \u201cno.\u201d In this way, rejection actually makes our relationships better and our emotional lives healthier.  Boundaries Once upon a time, there were two youngsters, a boy and a girl."}, {"text": " Their families hated each other. But the boy snuck into a party hosted by the girl\u2019s family because he was kind of a dick. The girl sees the boy, and angels sing so  \fsweetly to her lady-parts that she instantly falls in love with him. Just like that. And so he sneaks into her garden and they decide to get married the next freaking day, because, you know, that\u2019s totally practical, especially when your parents want to murder each other."}, {"text": " Jump ahead a few days. Their families find out about the marriage and throw a shit-fit. Mercutio dies. The girl is so upset that she drinks a potion that will put her to sleep for two days. But, unfortunately, the young couple hasn\u2019t learned the ins and outs of good marital communication yet, and the young girl totally forgets to mention something about it to her new husband."}, {"text": " The young man therefore  \fmistakes his new wife\u2019s self-induced coma for suicide. He then totally loses his marbles and he commits suicide, thinking he\u2019s going to be with her in the afterlife or some shit. But then she wakes up from her two-day coma, only to learn that her new husband has committed suicide, so she has the exact same idea and kills herself too."}, {"text": " The end. Romeo and Juliet is synonymous with \u201cromance\u201d in our culture today. It is seen as the love story in Englishspeaking culture, an emotional ideal to live up to. Yet when you really get down to what happens in the story, these kids are absolutely out of their fucking minds. And they just killed themselves to prove  \fit! It\u2019s suspected by many scholars that Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet not to celebrate romance, but rather to satirize it, to show how absolutely nutty it was."}, {"text": " He didn\u2019t mean for the play to be a glorification of love. In fact, he meant it to be the opposite: a big flashing neon sign blinking KEEP OUT, with police tape around it saying DO NOT CROSS. For most of human history, romantic love was not celebrated as it is now. In fact, up until the mid-nineteenth century or so, love was seen as an unnecessary and potentially dangerous psychological impediment to the more important things in life\u2014you know, like farming well  \fand/or marrying a guy with a lot of sheep."}, {"text": " Young people were often forcibly steered clear of their romantic passions in favor of practical economic marriages that would yield stability for both them and their families. But today, we all get brain boners for this kind of batshit crazy love. It dominates our culture.

Like, frighteningly similar to cocaine."}, {"text": " Like, stimulates the exact same parts of your brain as cocaine. Like, gets you high and makes you feel good for a  \fwhile but also creates as many problems as it solves, as does cocaine. Most elements of romantic love that we pursue\u2014the dramatic and dizzyingly emotional displays of affection, the topsy-turvy ups and downs\u2014aren\u2019t healthy, genuine displays of love."}, {"text": " In fact, they\u2019re often just another form of entitlement playing out through people\u2019s relationships. I know: that makes me sound like such a downer. Seriously, what kind of guy shits on romantic love? But hear me out. The truth is, there are healthy forms of love and unhealthy forms of love. Unhealthy love is based on two people  \ftrying to escape their problems through their emotions for each other\u2014in other words, they\u2019re using each other as an escape."}, {"text": " Healthy love is based on two people acknowledging and addressing their own problems with each other\u2019s support. The difference between a healthy and an unhealthy relationship comes down to two things: 1) how well each person in the relationship accepts responsibility, and 2) the willingness of each person to both reject and be rejected by their partner."}, {"text": " Anywhere there is an unhealthy or toxic relationship, there will be a poor and porous sense of responsibility on  \fboth sides, and there will be an inability to give and/or receive rejection. Wherever there is a healthy and loving relationship, there will be clear boundaries between the two people and their values, and there will be an open avenue of giving and receiving rejection when necessary."}, {"text": " By \u201cboundaries\u201d I mean the delineation between two people\u2019s responsibilities for their own problems. People in a healthy relationship with strong boundaries will take responsibility for their own values and problems and not take responsibility for their partner\u2019s values and problems. People in a toxic relationship with poor  \for no boundaries will regularly avoid responsibility for their own problems and/or take responsibility for their partner\u2019s problems."}, {"text": " What do poor boundaries look like? Here are some examples: \u201cYou can\u2019t go out with your friends without me. You know how jealous I get. You have to stay home with me.\u201d \u201cMy coworkers are idiots; they always make me late to meetings because I have to tell them how to do their jobs.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t believe you made me feel so stupid in front of my own sister."}, {"text": " Never disagree with me  \fin front of her again!\u201d \u201cI\u2019d love to take that job in Milwaukee, but my mother would never forgive me for moving so far away.\u201d \u201cI can date you, but can you not tell my friend Cindy? She gets really insecure when I have a boyfriend and she doesn\u2019t.\u201d In each scenario, the person is either taking responsibility for problems/emotions that are not theirs, or demanding that someone else take responsibility for their problems/emotions."}, {"text": " In general, entitled people fall into one of two traps in their relationships.  \fEither they expect other people to take responsibility for their problems: \u201cI wanted a nice relaxing weekend at home. You should have known that and canceled your plans.\u201d Or they take on too much responsibility for other people\u2019s problems: \u201cShe just lost her job again, but it\u2019s probably my fault because I wasn\u2019t as supportive of her as I could have been."}, {"text": " I\u2019m going to help her rewrite her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 tomorrow.\u201d Entitled people adopt these strategies in their relationships, as with everything, to help avoid accepting responsibility for their own problems. As a result, their relationships are fragile and fake, products of avoiding  \finner pain rather than embracing a genuine appreciation and adoration of their partner."}, {"text": " This goes not just for romantic relationships, by the way, but also for family relationships and friendships. An overbearing mother may take responsibility for every problem in her children\u2019s lives. Her own entitlement then encourages an entitlement in her children, as they grow up to believe other people should always be responsible for their problems."}, {"text": " (This is why the problems in your romantic relationships always eerily resemble the problems in your parents\u2019 relationship.)  \fWhen you have murky areas of responsibility for your emotions and actions\u2014areas where it\u2019s unclear who is responsible for what, whose fault is what, why you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing\u2014you never develop strong values for yourself."}, {"text": " Your only value becomes making your partner happy. Or your only value becomes your partner making you happy. This is self-defeating, of course.

People can\u2019t solve your problems for you."}, {"text": " And they shouldn\u2019t try, because  \fthat won\u2019t make you happy. You can\u2019t solve other people\u2019s problems for them either, because that likewise won\u2019t make them happy. The mark of an unhealthy relationship is two people who try to solve each other\u2019s problems in order to feel good about themselves."}, {"text": " Rather, a healthy relationship is when two people solve their own problems in order to feel good about each other. The setting of proper boundaries doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t help or support your partner or be helped and supported yourself. You both should support each other. But only because you choose to support and be supported."}, {"text": " Not because you feel obligated or entitled.  \fEntitled people who blame others for their own emotions and actions do so because they believe that if they constantly paint themselves as victims, eventually someone will come along and save them, and they will receive the love they\u2019ve always wanted."}, {"text": " Entitled people who take the blame for other people\u2019s emotions and actions do so because they believe that if they \u201cfix\u201d their partner and save him or her, they will receive the love and appreciation they\u2019ve always wanted. These are the yin and yang of any toxic relationship: the victim and the saver, the person who starts fires because it makes her feel important and  \fthe person who puts out fires because it makes him feel important."}, {"text": " These two types of people are drawn strongly to one another, and they usually end up together. Their pathologies match one another perfectly. Often they\u2019ve grown up with parents who each exhibit one of these traits as well. So their model for a \u201chappy\u201d relationship is one based on entitlement and poor boundaries."}, {"text": " Sadly, they both fail in meeting the other\u2019s actual needs. In fact, their pattern of overblaming and overaccepting blame perpetuates the entitlement and shitty self-worth that have been keeping them from getting their emotional needs met in  \fthe first place. The victim creates more and more problems to solve\u2014not because additional real problems exist, but because it gets her the attention and affection she craves."}, {"text": " The saver solves and solves\u2014not because she actually cares about the problems, but because she believes she must fix others\u2019 problems in order to deserve attention and affection for herself. In both cases, the intentions are selfish and conditional and therefore self-sabotaging, and genuine love is rarely experienced."}, {"text": " The victim, if he really loved the saver, would say, \u201cLook, this is my problem; you don\u2019t have to fix it for me.

Instead, victims and savers both use each other to achieve emotional highs."}, {"text": " It\u2019s like an addiction they fulfill in one another. Ironically, when presented with emotionally healthy people to date, they usually feel bored or lack \u201cchemistry\u201d  \fwith them.

They\u2019ve spent their whole life believing that others are responsible for their fate. That first step of taking responsibility for themselves is often terrifying. For savers, the hardest thing to do in the world is to stop taking responsibility for other people\u2019s problems."}, {"text": " They\u2019ve spent their whole life feeling valued and  \floved only when they\u2019re saving somebody else\u2014so letting go of this need is terrifying to them as well.

Acts of love are valid only if they\u2019re performed without conditions or expectations. It can be difficult for people to recognize the difference between doing  \fsomething out of obligation and doing it voluntarily."}, {"text": " So here\u2019s a litmus test: ask yourself, \u201cIf I refused, how would the relationship change?\u201d Similarly, ask, \u201cIf my partner refused something I wanted, how would the relationship change?\u201d If the answer is that a refusal would cause a blowout of drama and broken china plates, then that\u2019s a bad sign for your relationship."}, {"text": " It suggests that your relationship is conditional\u2014based on superficial benefits received from one another, rather than on unconditional acceptance of each other (along with each other\u2019s problems).

People with weak boundaries are terrified of those things and will constantly mold their own behavior to fit the highs and lows of their relational emotional roller coaster."}, {"text": " People with strong boundaries understand that it\u2019s unreasonable to expect two people to accommodate each other 100 percent and fulfill every need the other has. People with strong boundaries understand that they may hurt someone\u2019s feelings sometimes, but ultimately they can\u2019t determine how other people feel."}, {"text": " People with strong boundaries understand that a healthy relationship is not about controlling one another\u2019s emotions, but rather about each  \fpartner supporting the other in their individual growth and in solving their own problems.

How to Build Trust My wife is one of those women who spend a lot of time in front of the mirror. She loves to look amazing, and I love for her to look amazing too (obviously).

Maybe she tried to do something new with her hair, or decided to wear a pair of boots that some flamboyant fashion designer from Milan thought were avantgarde.

When I tell her this, she usually gets pissed off."}, {"text": " As she marches back into the closet or the bathroom to redo everything and make us thirty minutes late, she spouts a bunch of four-letter words and sometimes even slings a few of them in my direction. Men stereotypically lie in this  \fsituation to make their girlfriends/wives happy. But I don\u2019t. Why? Because honesty in my relationship is more important to me than feeling good all the time."}, {"text": " The last person I should ever have to censor myself with is the woman I love. Fortunately, I\u2019m married to a woman who agrees and is willing to hear my uncensored thoughts. She calls me out on my bullshit too, of course, which is one of the most important traits she offers me as a partner. Sure, my ego gets bruised sometimes, and I bitch and complain and try to argue, but a few hours later I come sulking back and admit that she was right."}, {"text": " And holy crap she makes me a  \fbetter person, even though I hate hearing it at the time. When our highest priority is to always make ourselves feel good, or to always make our partner feel good, then nobody ends up feeling good. And our relationship falls apart without our even knowing it. Without conflict, there can be no trust."}, {"text": " Conflict exists to show us who is there for us unconditionally and who is just there for the benefits. No one trusts a yes-man. If Disappointment Panda were here, he\u2019d tell you that the pain in our relationship is necessary to cement our trust in each other and produce greater intimacy.  \fFor a relationship to be healthy, both people must be willing and able to both say no and hear no."}, {"text": " Without that negation, without that occasional rejection, boundaries break down and one person\u2019s problems and values come to dominate the other\u2019s. Conflict is not only normal, then; it\u2019s absolutely necessary for the maintenance of a healthy relationship. If two people who are close are not able to hash out their differences openly and vocally, then the relationship is based on manipulation and misrepresentation, and it will slowly become toxic."}, {"text": " Trust is the most important ingredient in any relationship, for the simple reason  \fthat without trust, the relationship doesn\u2019t actually mean anything. A person could tell you that she loves you, wants to be with you, would give up everything for you, but if you don\u2019t trust her, you get no benefit from those statements."}, {"text": " You don\u2019t feel loved until you trust that the love being expressed toward you comes without any special conditions or baggage attached to it. This is what\u2019s so destructive about cheating. It\u2019s not about the sex. It\u2019s about the trust that has been destroyed as a result of the sex. Without trust, the relationship can no longer function."}, {"text": " So it\u2019s either rebuild the trust or say your goodbyes.  \fI often get emails from people who have been cheated on by their significant other but want to stay with that partner and are wondering how they can trust him or her again. Without trust, they tell me, the relationship has begun to feel like a burden, like a threat that must be monitored and questioned rather than enjoyed."}, {"text": " The problem here is that most people who get caught cheating apologize and give the \u201cIt will never happen again\u201d spiel and that\u2019s that, as if penises fell into various orifices completely by accident.

If people cheat, it\u2019s because something other than the relationship is more important to them. It may be power over others. It may be validation through sex."}, {"text": " It may be giving in to their own impulses. Whatever it is, it\u2019s clear that the cheater\u2019s values are not aligned in a way to support a healthy relationship. And if the cheater doesn\u2019t admit this or  \fcome to terms with it, if he just gives the old \u201cI don\u2019t know what I was thinking; I was stressed out and drunk and she was there\u201d response, then he lacks the serious self-awareness necessary to solve any relationship problems."}, {"text": " What needs to happen is that cheaters have to start peeling away at their self-awareness onion and figure out what fucked-up values caused them to break the trust of the relationship (and whether they actually still value the relationship). They need to be able to say, \u201cYou know what: I am selfish."}, {"text": " I care about myself more than the relationship; to be honest, I don\u2019t really respect the relationship much at all.\u201d If cheaters  \fcan\u2019t express their shitty values, and show that those values have been overridden, then there\u2019s no reason to believe that they can be trusted. And if they can\u2019t be trusted, then the relationship is not going to get better or change."}, {"text": " The other factor in regaining trust after it\u2019s been broken is a practical one: a track record. If someone breaks your trust, words are nice; but you then need to see a consistent track record of improved behavior. Only then can you begin trusting that the cheater\u2019s values are now aligned properly and the person really will change."}, {"text": " Unfortunately, building a track  \frecord for trust takes time\u2014certainly a lot more time than it takes to break trust. And during that trust-building period, things are likely to be pretty shitty. So both people in the relationship must be conscious of the struggle they\u2019re choosing to undertake."}, {"text": " I use the example of cheating in a romantic relationship, but this process applies to a breach in any relationship. When trust is destroyed, it can be rebuilt only if the following two steps happen: 1) the trust-breaker admits the true values that caused the breach and owns up to them, and 2) the trust-breaker builds a solid track record of improved behavior over time."}, {"text": " Without the first  \fstep, there should be no attempt at reconciliation in the first place. Trust is like a china plate. If you break it once, with some care and attention you can put it back together again. But if you break it again, it splits into even more pieces and it takes far longer to piece together again."}, {"text": " If you break it more and more times, eventually it shatters to the point where it\u2019s impossible to restore. There are too many broken pieces, and too much dust.  Freedom Commitment  Through  Consumer culture is very good at making us want more, more, more. Underneath  \fall the hype and marketing is the implication that more is always better."}, {"text": " I bought into this idea for years. Make more money, visit more countries, have more experiences, be with more women. But more is not always better. In fact, the opposite is true. We are actually often happier with less. When we\u2019re overloaded with opportunities and options, we suffer from what psychologists refer to as the paradox of choice."}, {"text": " Basically, the more options we\u2019re given, the less satisfied we become with whatever we choose, because we\u2019re aware of all the other options we\u2019re potentially forfeiting. So if you have a choice between two  \fplaces to live and pick one, you\u2019ll likely feel confident and comfortable that you made the right choice."}, {"text": " You\u2019ll be satisfied with your decision. But if you have a choice among twenty-eight places to live and pick one, the paradox of choice says that you\u2019ll likely spend years agonizing, doubting, and second-guessing yourself, wondering if you really made the \u201cright\u201d choice, and if you\u2019re truly maximizing your own happiness."}, {"text": " And this anxiety, this desire for certainty and perfection and success, will make you unhappy. So what do we do? Well, if you\u2019re like I used to be, you avoid choosing anything at all. You aim to keep your  \foptions open as long as possible. You avoid commitment. But while investing deeply in one person, one place, one job, one activity might deny us the breadth of experience we\u2019d like, pursuing a breadth of experience denies us the opportunity to experience the rewards of depth of experience."}, {"text": " There are some experiences that you can have only when you\u2019ve lived in the same place for five years, when you\u2019ve been with the same person for over a decade, when you\u2019ve been working on the same skill or craft for half your lifetime. Now that I\u2019m in my thirties, I can finally recognize that commitment, in its own way, offers a  \fwealth of opportunity and experiences that would otherwise never be available to me, no matter where I went or what I did."}, {"text": " When you\u2019re pursuing a wide breadth of experience, there are diminishing returns to each new adventure, each new person or thing. When you\u2019ve never left your home country, the first country you visit inspires a massive perspective shift, because you have such a narrow experience base to draw on."}, {"text": " But when you\u2019ve been to twenty countries, the twenty-first adds little. And when you\u2019ve been to fifty, the fifty-first adds even less.  \fThe same goes for material possessions, money, hobbies, jobs, friends, and romantic/sexual partners\u2014 all the lame superficial values people choose for themselves."}, {"text": " The older you get, the more experienced you get, the less significantly each new experience affects you. The first time I drank at a party was exciting. The hundredth time was fun. The five hundredth time felt like a normal weekend. And the thousandth time felt boring and unimportant. The big story for me personally over the past few years has been my ability to open myself up to commitment."}, {"text": " I\u2019ve chosen to reject all but the very best  \fpeople and experiences and values in my life. I shut down all my business projects and decided to focus on writing fulltime. Since then, my website has become more popular than I\u2019d ever imagined possible. I\u2019ve committed to one woman for the long haul and, to my surprise, have found this more rewarding than any of the flings, trysts, and one-night stands I had in the past."}, {"text": " I\u2019ve committed to a single geographic location and doubled down on the handful of my significant, genuine, healthy friendships. And what I\u2019ve discovered is something entirely counterintuitive: that there is a freedom and liberation in commitment. I\u2019ve found increased  \fopportunity and upside in rejecting alternatives and distractions in favor of what I\u2019ve chosen to let truly matter to me."}, {"text": " Commitment gives you freedom because you\u2019re no longer distracted by the unimportant and frivolous. Commitment gives you freedom because it hones your attention and focus, directing them toward what is most efficient at making you healthy and happy. Commitment makes decisionmaking easier and removes any fear of missing out; knowing that what you already have is good enough, why would you ever stress about chasing more, more, more again? Commitment allows  \fyou to focus intently on a few highly important goals and achieve a greater degree of success than you otherwise would."}, {"text": " In this way, the rejection of alternatives liberates us\u2014rejection of what does not align with our most important values, with our chosen metrics, rejection of the constant pursuit of breadth without depth.

And Then You Die  Seek the truth for yourself, and I will meet you there.\u201d That was the last thing Josh ever said to me."}, {"text": " He said it ironically, attempting to sound deep while simultaneously making fun of people who attempt to sound deep. He was drunk and high. And he was a good friend. The most transformational moment of  \fmy life occurred when I was nineteen years old. My friend Josh had taken me to a party on a lake just north of Dallas, Texas."}, {"text": " There were condos on a hill and below the hill was a pool, and below the pool was a cliff overlooking the lake. It was a small cliff, maybe thirty feet high \u2014certainly high enough to give you a second thought about jumping, but low enough that with the right combination of alcohol and peer pressure that second thought could easily vanish."}, {"text": " Shortly after arriving at the party, Josh and I sat in the pool together, drinking beers and talking as young angsty males do. We talked about drinking and bands and girls and all of  \fthe cool stuff Josh had done that summer since dropping out of music school. We talked about playing in a band together and moving to New York City\u2014an impossible dream at the time."}, {"text": " We were just kids. \u201cIs it okay to jump off that?\u201d I asked after a while, nodding toward the cliff over the lake. \u201cYeah,\u201d Josh said, \u201cpeople do it all the time here.\u201d \u201cAre you going to do it?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cMaybe. We\u2019ll see.\u201d Later in the evening, Josh and I got separated. I had become distracted by a pretty Asian girl who liked video games, which to me, as a teenage nerd, was akin  \fto winning the lottery."}, {"text": " She had no interest in me, but she was friendly and happy to let me talk, so I talked. After a few beers, I gathered enough courage to ask her to go up to the house with me to get some food. She said sure. As we walked up the hill, we bumped into Josh coming down. I asked him if he wanted food, but he declined."}, {"text": " I asked him where I could find him later on. He smiled and said, \u201cSeek the truth for yourself, and I will meet you there!\u201d I nodded and made a serious face. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll see you there,\u201d I replied, as if everyone knew exactly where the truth was and how to get to it. Josh laughed and walked down the  \fhill toward the cliff."}, {"text": " I laughed and continued up the hill toward the house. I don\u2019t remember how long I was inside. I just remember that when the girl and I came out again, everyone was gone and there were sirens. The pool was empty. People were running down the hill toward the shoreline below the cliff. There were others already down by the water."}, {"text": " I could make out a couple guys swimming around. It was dark and hard to see. The music droned on, but nobody listened. Still not putting two-and-two together, I hurried down to the shoreline, gnawing on my sandwich, curious as to what everyone was looking at. Halfway  \fdown, the pretty Asian girl said to me, \u201cI think something terrible has happened."}, {"text": "\u201d When I got to the bottom of the hill, I asked someone where Josh was. No one looked at me or acknowledged me. Everyone stared at the water. I asked again, and a girl started crying uncontrollably. That\u2019s when I put two-and-two together. It took scuba divers three hours to find Josh\u2019s body at the bottom of the lake."}, {"text": " The autopsy would later say that his legs had cramped up due to dehydration from the alcohol, as well as to the impact of the jump from the cliff. It was dark out when he went in, the water  \flayered on the night, black on black. No one could see where his screams for help were coming from. Just the splashes."}, {"text": " Just the sounds. His parents later told me that he was a terrible swimmer. I\u2019d had no idea. It took me twelve hours to let myself cry. I was in my car, driving back home to Austin the next morning. I called my dad and told him that I was still near Dallas and that I was going to miss work. (I\u2019d been working for him that summer."}, {"text": ") He asked, \u201cWhy; what happened? Is everything all right?\u201d And that\u2019s when it all came out: the waterworks. The wails and the screams and the snot. I pulled the car over to the  \fside of the road and clutched the phone and cried the way a little boy cries to his father. I went into a deep depression that summer."}, {"text": " I thought I\u2019d been depressed before, but this was a whole new level of meaninglessness\u2014sadness so deep that it physically hurt. People would come by and try to cheer me up, and I would sit there and hear them say all the right things and do all the right things; and I would tell them thank you and how nice it was of them to come over, and I would fake a smile and lie and say that it was getting better, but underneath I just felt nothing."}, {"text": " I dreamed about Josh for a few  \fmonths after that. Dreams where he and I would have full-blown conversations about life and death, as well as about random, pointless things. Up until that point in my life, I had been a pretty typical middle-class stoner kid: lazy, irresponsible, socially anxious, and deeply insecure."}, {"text": " Josh, in many ways, had been a person I looked up to. He was older, more confident, more experienced, and more accepting of and open to the world around him. In one of my last dreams of Josh, I was sitting in a Jacuzzi with him (yeah, I know, weird), and I said something like, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry you died."}, {"text": "\u201d He laughed. I don\u2019t remember exactly what his words were,  \fbut he said something like, \u201cWhy do you care that I\u2019m dead when you\u2019re still so afraid to live?\u201d I woke up crying. It was sitting on my mom\u2019s couch that summer, staring into the so-called abyss, seeing the endless and incomprehensible nothingness where Josh\u2019s friendship used to be, when I came to the startling realization that if there really is no reason to do anything, then there is also no reason to not do anything; that in the face of the inevitability of death, there is no reason to ever give in to one\u2019s fear or embarrassment or shame, since it\u2019s all just a bunch of nothing anyway; and that by spending the majority of my short life  \favoiding what was painful and uncomfortable, I had essentially been avoiding being alive at all."}, {"text": " That summer, I gave up the weed and the cigarettes and the video games. I gave up my silly rock star fantasies and dropped out of music school and signed up for college courses. I started going to the gym and lost a bunch of weight. I made new friends. I got my first girlfriend. For the first time in my life I actually studied for classes, gaining me the startling realization that I could make good grades if only I gave a shit."}, {"text": " The next summer, I challenged myself to read fifty nonfiction books in fifty days, and then did it. The following year, I  \ftransferred to an excellent university on the other side of the country, where I excelled for the first time, both academically and socially. Josh\u2019s death marks the clearest before/after point I can identify in my life."}, {"text": " Pre-tragedy, I was inhibited, unambitious, forever obsessed and confined by what I imagined the world might be thinking of me. Post-tragedy, I morphed into a new person: responsible, curious,hardworking. I still had my insecurities and my baggage\u2014as we always do\u2014but now I gave a fuck about something more important than my insecurities and my baggage."}, {"text": " And that made all the difference. Oddly, it was  \fsomeone else\u2019s death that gave me permission to finally live. And perhaps the worst moment of my life was also the most transformational. Death scares us. And because it scares us, we avoid thinking about it, talking about it, sometimes even acknowledging it, even when it\u2019s happening to someone close to us."}, {"text": " Yet, in a bizarre, backwards way, death is the light by which the shadow of all of life\u2019s meaning is measured. Without death, everything would feel inconsequential, all experience arbitrary, all metrics and values suddenly zero.  Something  Beyond  Our  \fSelves Ernest Becker was an academic outcast."}, {"text": " In 1960, he got his Ph.D. in anthropology; his doctoral research compared the unlikely and unconventional practices of Zen Buddhism and psychoanalysis. At the time, Zen was seen as something for hippies and drug addicts, and Freudian psychoanalysis was considered a quack form of psychology left over from the Stone Age."}, {"text": " In his first job as an assistant professor, Becker quickly fell into a crowd that denounced the practice of psychiatry as a form of fascism. They saw the practice as an unscientific form  \fof oppression against the weak and helpless. The problem was that Becker\u2019s boss was a psychiatrist. So it was kind of like walking into your first job and proudly comparing your boss to Hitler."}, {"text": " As you can imagine, he was fired. So Becker took his radical ideas somewhere that they might be accepted: Berkeley, California. But this, too, didn\u2019t last long. Because it wasn\u2019t just his antiestablishment tendencies that got Becker into trouble; it was his odd teaching methods as well. He would use Shakespeare to teach psychology, psychology textbooks to teach  \fanthropology, and anthropological data to teach sociology."}, {"text": " He\u2019d dress up as King Lear and do mock sword fights in class and go on long political rants that had little to do with the lesson plan. His students adored him. The other faculty loathed him. Less than a year later, he was fired again. Becker then landed at San Francisco State University, where he actually kept his job for more than a year."}, {"text": " But when student protests erupted over the Vietnam War, the university called in the National Guard and things got violent. When Becker sided with the students and publicly condemned the actions of the dean (again, his boss being Hitleresque  \fand everything), he was, once again, promptly fired. Becker changed jobs four times in six years."}, {"text": " And before he could get fired from the fifth, he got colon cancer. The prognosis was grim. He spent the next few years bedridden and had little hope of surviving. So Becker decided to write a book. This book would be about death. Becker died in 1974. His book The Denial of Death, would win the Pulitzer Prize and become one of the most influential intellectual works of the twentieth century, shaking up the fields of psychology and anthropology, while making profound philosophical claims that are still influential today."}, {"text": "  \fThe Denial of Death essentially makes two points: 1.  Humans are unique in that we\u2019re the only animals that can conceptualize and think about ourselves abstractly. Dogs don\u2019t sit around and worry about their career. Cats don\u2019t think about their past mistakes or wonder what would have happened if they\u2019d done something differently."}, {"text": " Monkeys don\u2019t argue over future possibilities, just as fish don\u2019t sit around wondering if other fish would like them more if they had longer fins. As humans, we\u2019re blessed with the ability to imagine ourselves in hypothetical situations, to  \fcontemplate both the past and the future, to imagine other realities or situations where things might be different."}, {"text": " And it\u2019s because of this unique mental ability, Becker says, that we all, at some point, become aware of the inevitability of our own death. Because we\u2019re able to conceptualize alternate versions of reality, we are also the only animal capable of imagining a reality without ourselves in it. This realization causes what Becker calls \u201cdeath terror,\u201d a deep existential anxiety that underlies everything we think or do."}, {"text": " 2. Becker\u2019s second point starts with the  \fpremise that we essentially have two \u201cselves.\u201d The first self is the physical self\u2014the one that eats, sleeps, snores, and poops. The second self is our conceptual self\u2014 our identity, or how we see ourselves. Becker\u2019s argument is this: We are all aware on some level that our physical self will eventually die, that this death is inevitable, and that its inevitability\u2014on some unconscious level\u2014scares the shit out of us."}, {"text": " Therefore, in order to compensate for our fear of the inevitable loss of our physical self, we try to construct a conceptual self that will live  \fforever. This is why people try so hard to put their names on buildings, on statues, on spines of books. It\u2019s why we feel compelled to spend so much time giving ourselves to others, especially to children, in the hopes that our influence\u2014our conceptual self\u2014will last way beyond our physical self."}, {"text": " That we will be remembered and revered and idolized long after our physical self ceases to exist. Becker called such efforts our \u201cimmortality projects,\u201d projects that allow our conceptual self to live on way past the point of our physical death. All of human civilization, he  \fsays, is basically a result of immortality projects: the cities and governments and structures and authorities in place today were all immortality projects of men and women who came before us."}, {"text": " They are the remnants of conceptual selves that ceased to die. Names like Jesus, Muhammad, Napoleon, and Shakespeare are just as powerful today as when those men lived, if not more so. And that\u2019s the whole point. Whether it be through mastering an art form, conquering a new land, gaining great riches, or simply having a large and loving family that will live on for generations, all the  \fmeaning in our life is shaped by this innate desire to never truly die."}, {"text": " Religion, politics, sports, art, and technological innovation are the result of people\u2019s immortality projects. Becker argues that wars and revolutions and mass murder occur when one group of people\u2019s immortality projects rub up against another group\u2019s. Centuries of oppression and the bloodshed of millions have been justified as the defense of one group\u2019s immortality project against another\u2019s."}, {"text": " But, when our immortality projects fail, when the meaning is lost, when the prospect of our conceptual self outliving our physical self no longer seems  \fpossible or likely, death terror\u2014that horrible, depressing anxiety\u2014creeps back into our mind. Trauma can cause this, as can shame and social ridicule."}, {"text": " As can, as Becker points out, mental illness. If you haven\u2019t figured it out yet, our immortality projects are our values. They are the barometers of meaning and worth in our life. And when our values fail, so do we, psychologically speaking. What Becker is saying, in essence, is that we\u2019re all driven by fear to give way too many fucks about something, because giving a fuck about something is the only thing that distracts us from the reality and inevitability of our own death."}, {"text": " And  \fto truly not give a single fuck is to achieve a quasi-spiritual state of embracing the impermanence of one\u2019s own existence. In that state, one is far less likely to get caught up in various forms of entitlement. Becker later came to a startling realization on his deathbed: that people\u2019s immortality projects were actually the problem, not the solution; that rather than attempting to implement, often through lethal force, their conceptual self across the world, people should question their conceptual self and become more comfortable with the reality of their own death."}, {"text": " Becker called this \u201cthe bitter antidote,\u201d and struggled  \fwith reconciling it himself as he stared down his own demise. While death is bad, it is inevitable. Therefore, we should not avoid this realization, but rather come to terms with it as best we can. Because once we become comfortable with the fact of our own death\u2014the root terror, the underlying anxiety motivating all of life\u2019s frivolous ambitions\u2014we can then choose our values more freely, unrestrained by the illogical quest for immortality, and freed from dangerous dogmatic views."}, {"text": "  The Sunny Side of Death I step from rock to rock, climbing steadily, leg muscles stretching and  \faching. In that trancelike state that comes from slow, repetitive physical exertion, I\u2019m nearing the top. The sky gets wide and deep. I\u2019m alone now. My friends are far below me, taking pictures of the ocean."}, {"text": " Finally, I climb over a small boulder and the view opens up. I can see from here to the infinite horizon. It feels as though I\u2019m staring at the edge of the earth, where water meets the sky, blue on blue. The wind screams across my skin. I look up. It\u2019s bright. It\u2019s beautiful. I\u2019m at South Africa\u2019s Cape of Good Hope, once thought to be the southern tip of Africa and the southernmost point in the world."}, {"text": " It\u2019s a tumultuous place, a  \fplace full of storms and treacherous waters. A place that\u2019s seen centuries of trade and commerce and human endeavor. A place, ironically, of lost hopes. There is a saying in Portuguese: Ele dobra o Cabo da Boa Esperan\u00e7a. It means, \u201cHe\u2019s rounding the Cape of Good Hope."}, {"text": "\u201d Ironically, it means that the person\u2019s life is in its final phase, that he\u2019s incapable of accomplishing anything more.

The wind is slapping my ears."}, {"text": " I hear  \fnothing, but I see the edge: where the rock meets oblivion. I stop and stand for a moment, several yards away. I can see the ocean below, lapping and frothing against cliffs stretching out for miles to either side. The tides are furious against the impenetrable walls. Straight ahead, it\u2019s a sheer drop of at least fifty yards to the water below."}, {"text": " To my right, tourists are dotted across the landscape below, snapping photos and aggregating themselves into antlike formations. To my left is Asia. In front of me is the sky and behind is me is everything I\u2019ve ever hoped for and brought with me. What if this is it? What if this is all  \fthere is? I look around."}, {"text": " I\u2019m alone. I take my first step toward the edge of the cliff. The human body seems to come equipped with a natural radar for deathinducing situations. For example, the moment you get within about ten feet of a cliff edge, minus guardrail, a certain tension digs into your body. Your back stiffens."}, {"text": " Your skin ripples. Your eyes become hyperfocused on every detail of your environment. Your feet feel as though they\u2019re made of rock. It\u2019s as if there were a big, invisible magnet gently pulling your body back to safety. But I fight the magnet. I drag the feet made of rock closer to the edge.  \fAt five feet away, your mind joins the party."}, {"text": " You can now see not only the edge of the cliff, but down the cliff face itself, which induces all sorts of unwanted visualizations of tripping and falling and tumbling to a splashy death. It\u2019s really fucking far, your mind reminds you. Like, really fucking far. Dude, what are you doing? Stop moving."}, {"text": " Stop it. I tell my mind to shut up, and keep inching forward. At three feet, your body goes into full-scale red alert. You are now within an errant shoelace-trip of your life ending. It feels as though a hefty gust of wind could send you sailing off into that blue-bisected eternity. Your legs shake."}, {"text": "  \fAs do your hands. As does your voice, in case you need to remind yourself you\u2019re not about to plummet to your death. The three-foot distance is most people\u2019s absolute limit. It\u2019s just close enough to lean forward and catch a glimpse of the bottom, but still far enough to feel as though you\u2019re not at any real risk of killing yourself."}, {"text": " Standing that close to the edge of a cliff, even one as beautiful and mesmerizing as the Cape of Good Hope, induces a heady sense of vertigo, and threatens to regurgitate any recent meal. Is this it? Is this all there is? Do I already know everything I will ever  \fknow? I take another microstep, then another."}, {"text": " Two feet now. My forward leg vibrates as I put the weight of my body on it. I shuffle on. Against the magnet. Against my mind. Against all my better instincts for survival. One foot now. I\u2019m now looking straight down the cliff face. I feel a sudden urge to cry. My body instinctively crouches, protecting itself against something imagined and inexplicable."}, {"text": " The wind comes in hailstorms. The thoughts come in right hooks. At one foot you feel like you\u2019re floating. Anything but looking straight  \fdown feels as though you\u2019re part of the sky itself. You actually kind of expect to fall at this point. I crouch there for a moment, catching my breath, collecting my thoughts."}, {"text": " I force myself to stare down at the water hitting the rocks below me. Then I look again to my right, at the little ants milling about the signage below me, snapping photos, chasing tour buses, on the off chance that somebody somehow sees me. This desire for attention is wholly irrational. But so is all of this."}, {"text": " It\u2019s impossible to make me out up here, of course. And even if it weren\u2019t, there\u2019s nothing that those distant people could say or do.  \fAll I hear is the wind. Is this it? My body shudders, the fear becoming euphoric and blinding. I focus my mind and clear my thoughts in a kind of meditation."}, {"text": " Nothing makes you present and mindful like being mere inches away from your own death. I straighten up and look out again, and find myself smiling. I remind myself that it\u2019s all right to die. This willing and even exuberant interfacing with one\u2019s own mortality has ancient roots. The Stoics of ancient Greece and Rome implored people to keep death in mind at all times, in order to appreciate life more and remain  \fhumble in the face of its adversities."}, {"text": " In various forms of Buddhism, the practice of meditation is often taught as a means of preparing oneself for death while still remaining alive. Dissolving one\u2019s ego into an expansive nothingness\u2014 achieving the enlightened state of nirvana\u2014is seen as a trial run of letting oneself cross to the other side."}, {"text": " Even Mark Twain, that hairy goofball who came in and left on Halley\u2019s Comet, said, \u201cThe fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.\u201d Back on the cliff, I bend down, slightly leaning back. I put my hands on the ground behind me and gently lower  \fmyself onto my butt."}, {"text": " I then gradually slide one leg over the edge of the cliff. There\u2019s a small rock jutting out of the cliff side. I rest my foot on it. Then I slide my other foot off the edge and put it on the same small rock. I sit there a moment, leaning back on my palms, wind ruffling my hair. The anxiety is bearable now, as long as I stay focused on the horizon."}, {"text": " Then I sit up straight and look down the cliff again. Fear shoots back up through my spine, electrifying my limbs and laser-focusing my mind on the exact coordinates of every inch of my body. The fear is stifling at times. But each time it stifles me, I empty my thoughts,  \ffocus my attention on the bottom of the cliff below me, force myself to gaze at my potential doom, and then to simply acknowledge its existence."}, {"text": " I was now sitting on the edge of the world, at the southern-most tip of hope, the gateway to the east. The feeling was exhilarating. I can feel the adrenaline pumping through my body. Being so still, so conscious, never felt so thrilling. I listen to the wind and watch the ocean and look out upon the ends of the earth\u2014 and then I laugh with the light, all that it touches being good."}, {"text": " Confronting the reality of our own mortality is important because it obliterates all the crappy, fragile,  \fsuperficial values in life. While most people whittle their days chasing another buck, or a little bit more fame and attention, or a little bit more assurance that they\u2019re right or loved, death confronts all of us with a far more painful and important question: What is your legacy? How will the world be different and better when you\u2019re gone? What mark will you have made? What influence will you have caused? They say that a butterfly flapping its wings in Africa can cause a hurricane in Florida; well, what hurricanes will you leave in your wake?

As long as you stay inside the familiar, risk-free zone of your present reality, the Big Snooze is content, but should you try and sneak past her to attend the rockin\u2019 party  \foutside, your overprotective, controlling mother is going to claw, scratch, scream, bite, hurl her body in front of your rapidly approaching new life\u2014basically she\u2019s going to do whatever she can to stop you."}, {"text": " And it ain\u2019t gonna be pretty.

Figure out which affirmations you need to hear the most and repeat them all day long in your head, in the car, while you\u2019re walking down the street pretending to be on the phone, under  \fyour breathe in line at the DMV.

DO THINGS YOU LOVE When you constantly deny yourself the people, food, things, and experiences that make you feel the most alive, that sends a pretty lousy message home.

It can be anything from spending a weekday  \fafternoon with a great friend to quitting your hateful job to buying a pair of completely impractical but completely awesome new shoes to going on a surf vacation in Costa Rica."}, {"text": " It\u2019s about being proactive about creating a life you love instead of meekly living the one you think you\u2019re stuck with.

FIND A REPLACEMENT We\u2019ve gotten so used to our negative knee-jerk reactions to ourselves that we never think to question them\u2014we simply take them as the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth. But once we  \fbecome aware of our thought patterns and behaviors, we can consciously change them."}, {"text": " So start paying attention: What runs through your mind when you look in the mirror?

Or when you get dumped by someone  \fwho is totally awesome? And hot? Or when you walk around all day with your fly open? Or when you leave your coffee on the roof of your car and drive off? Or when you let a friend down? Or when you stub your toe on the kitchen table for the tenth time? Or when you forget your dad\u2019s birthday? Or when you snap at someone who  \fdidn\u2019t quite deserve it as harshly as you gave it to them? Notice the verbiage that runs through your mind when you\u2019re being the most heinous to yourself and come up with a new-and-improved response."}, {"text": " For example, if every time you look in the mirror, your first thought is yikes, make a conscious effort to change it to hi, gorgeous! If you have a complicated relationship with your father and beat yourself up every time you say something awful to him, replace I\u2019m a monster with I\u2019m just a little bunny, working through my issues."}, {"text": " And then, of  \fcourse, apologize to him. If your standard response to screwing something up is ugh, Her Royal Clumsiness strikes again, replace it with what can I learn from this?

Do not spend your life clinging to the insulting decisions you\u2019ve made about yourself. Instead, make the conscious choice to replace them with new and improved ones.  5. DITCH THE SELFDEPRECATING HUMOR Incessant self-deprecating humor is for  \flosers. I get it\u2014it can be hilariously funny and I\u2019m totally guilty of it from time to time and there\u2019s nobody I\u2019d more enjoy backing over with my car than the guy who can\u2019t laugh at himself, but I\u2019m talking about the nonstop, selfflagellating, I Suckfest."}, {"text": " Ripping on yourself gets old. Fast. Especially if it\u2019s your shtick. So if you\u2019re one of those people who falls back on making fun of yourself, every hour on the hour, not only are you basically begging people to think you\u2019re a loser, but you\u2019re begging yourself to think you\u2019re a loser. It\u2019s like hitting yourself over and over with a crowbar."}, {"text": " Why on earth would you do that to your awesome self?  \fWhat you tell yourself on a daily basis is more powerful than you know. Seemingly harmless jokes, over time, turn into seriously destructive beliefs. Our thoughts become our words, our words become our beliefs, our beliefs become our actions, our actions become our habits, and our habits become our realities."}, {"text": " So if your favorite joke is that you couldn\u2019t get a date if you demanded one at gunpoint, and you spend every Saturday night alone, perhaps you should come up with a new one-liner. And most importantly, constantly making fun of yourself is such a cheap way to be funny. Anyone can do it. So push yourself to come up with a new  \fscript."}, {"text": " Your confidence, and we humor snobs, will thank you.  6. LET THE LOVE IN Receive compliments gracefully instead of countering with a disclaimer such as, \u201cOh, this ratty old thing?\u201d Try this instead: \u201cThank you.\u201d Period.

Move it, stretch it, nourish it, hydrate it, pay attention to it \u2014The better our bodies feel, the happier and more productive we are.  7. DON\u2019T COMPARE YOURSELF TO OTHERS Have you ever done something that you\u2019re so proud of and feel all on top of  \fthe world about until you see that someone else has done something similar that, in your mind, is better, and all of a sudden you feel sad?  Comparison is the fastest way to take all the fun out of life."}, {"text": " It\u2019s none of your business what other people are doing.

Call it up in your mind and feel it in your body. Repeat the following over and over while thinking of it and really feel what you\u2019re saying to yourself: Holding on to my bad feelings about this is doing nothing but harming me, and everyone else, and preventing me  \ffrom enjoying my life fully."}, {"text": " I am an awesome person. I choose to enjoy my life. I choose to let this go. Repeat this until you feel a sense of freedom and lightness around your issue.

TAKE THE FIRST RIGHT STEP Instead of wasting hours and days and years trying to figure out your perfect next move, just DO something already. Oh the time we waste rolling ideas around in our heads, imagining what-ifs, coming up with perfect reasons why and then perfect reasons why not, tearing at our cuticles, making our friends and  \ffamily carefully screen their calls in case it\u2019s us again, wanting to go over some ideas."}, {"text": " Get out of your head and take action. You don\u2019t have to know exactly where it\u2019s going to take you, you just need to start with one thing that feels right and keep following right-feeling things and see where they lead.

DON\u2019T GET CAUGHT UP IN THE THUNDERBOLT HYPE I think one of the most paralyzing misconceptions is that we\u2019re all supposed to have one true calling that comes to us in a mighty flash of souldefining insight.

LISTEN TO YOUR INTUITION If you really want to get in touch with who you are and what you love to do, and who you love to do it with, dedicate some time to tuning in to your intuition. One of the best ways to do this is to spend five minutes of quiet, by yourself, every day.

In less than a year\u2019s time we also wrote, produced, directed, and starred in a film about the record industry; wrote, directed, and starred in a music video that got on national television; recorded an EP, got a demo deal with Columbia Records, and even learned a couple more chords."}, {"text": " And we did it with full-time corporate jobs and no idea what we were doing. It was fun with a capital \u201cF.\u201d  There\u2019s  nothing  as  \funstoppable as a freight train full of fuck-yeah. If you\u2019ve ever known what it\u2019s like to be in your groove, and are having trouble finding your way right now, think back to your attitude and what your priorities were when you were totally lit up about life, and use them to help give you the clarity and the kick in the rear end you need now."}, {"text": " Here are some nuggets of wisdom I gleaned from the Crotch days that I still find useful:  \f1. JUST SEE WHAT YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH Life is r-i-d-i-c-u-l-o-u-s. It so seriously is\u2014we have no freakin\u2019 idea what we\u2019re even doing here spinning around on this globe in the middle of this solar system with who-the-hell-knows-what out there beyond it."}, {"text": " Making a big fat deal out of anything is absurd. It makes much more sense to go after life with a sense of, \u201cWhy not?\u201d instead of a furrowed brow. One of the best things I ever did was make my motto \u201cI just wanna see what I can get away with.\u201d It takes all the pressure off, puts the punk rock attitude in, and reminds me that life is but a  \fgame."}, {"text": " Yes, we have bigger responsibilities and more pressure as adults, but come on folks, I guarantee you there are countless people with waaaaaaaay more to whine about out there than you who are totally kicking ass because they decided to go for it instead of sitting around in the wet pantload of their own excuses."}, {"text": " Take a new approach to what you\u2019re doing and try this on: I just wanna see if I can start my own successful business; I just wanna see if I can get myself out of debt and make one hundred thousand dollars more this year; I just wanna see if I can lose a hundred pounds; I just wanna see if I  \fcan sell one of my paintings for fifty grand; I just wanna see if I can meet my soul mate."}, {"text": " Take the pressure off and get back in on the adventure.  2. LOSE TRACK OF TIME Have you ever been doing something and suddenly realized that hours have gone by without you noticing? What does that for you? And how often during your day does this happen? When you\u2019re so lost in what you\u2019re doing that you lose all sense of time, you have officially entered the Vortex."}, {"text": " You want to get your ass in there  \fas much as possible, so look at your life and figure out how you can make that happen. First, figure out the things you get lost in in your business and your personal life. Then figure out how you can be doing more of those things more of the time. Hire someone (no excuses) and delegate the tasks you hate doing."}, {"text": " Partner up with someone who\u2019s good at, and enjoys doing the things you\u2019re not that into, so you can be freed up to do more of what you want. If you have to, make massive changes in your business and your personal life to include more time doing what you love. Figure it out. Don\u2019t just hand your life over to your  \fcircumstances like a little wuss."}, {"text": " You can take your life wherever you want it to go, so grab it by its nether regions and make doing the things you love a priority.  3. KEEP BEING THE BEGINNER One of the best things about starting a band when you have no idea how to play your instrument is that you don\u2019t care if you stink because you already know you do."}, {"text": " Then once you learn how to play, you get all serious, you become overly critical and hard on yourself and don\u2019t  \flet yourself have nearly as much fun anymore. The trick is to let the Beginner live alongside the Expert, instead of pretending you don\u2019t know who she is when she tries to sit with you and your new, cooler, more experienced friends in the cafeteria."}, {"text": " The Beginner may be an idiot, but she knows how to party, and if you don\u2019t let her play with you anymore, things risk getting rather droll around here. So hone your skills; take your craft seriously; learn what you need to learn; invest in yourself; practice your ass off; fall down; get up; keep going; get really really really really good at what you do, but don\u2019t lose the fun in the process."}, {"text": " Because, like, what\u2019s the point of doing  \fall that work then? The only thing you need to do is do the very best you can. Once you\u2019ve done that, the only other thing that matters is that you enjoy yourself.  4.

She came up to the register with a six-pack of orange Tic Tacs and charmed her way into getting the whole thing, instead of being told to put it back and just buy one."}, {"text": " So we get back in the car and I ask her if I can have a pack, my only intent to teach the greedy little piglet a thing or two about sharing. \u201cOf course,\u201d she says and hands it over. She then asks, in her itty-bitty five-year-old voice, if my brother and my mom want one too, and hands them over."}, {"text": " My niece then takes her remaining three packs and places them  \fon the seat next to her in a pile saying, \u201cAnd when we get home, this one\u2019s for my brother, this one\u2019s for my sister, this one\u2019s for my mom.\u201d Then she sits there, with none left for herself, and smiles, more excited to give them away than she was when she was told she could buy them for herself."}, {"text": " I shot a confused look at my brother, Stephen, her father, and he mouthed back \u201cfreak.\u201d When Stephen and I were her age, we cherished nothing more than the tortured cries of the other.

As my niece so clearly understood, giving is one of our greatest joys. It\u2019s also one of the most fearless and powerful gestures there is. When we trust that we live in an abundant universe and allow ourselves to give freely, we raise our frequency, strengthen our faith, and feel awesome, thereby putting ourselves in flow and the position to receive abundant amounts in return."}, {"text": " When we\u2019re in fear, we hold on to what we\u2019ve got because we don\u2019t trust that there\u2019s more. We pinch off the energy, we\u2019re scared to share, and we focus on, and create more of, the very  \fthing we\u2019re hoping to avoid, which is lack. We live in a universe of give and receive, breathe and exhale, live and die, suck and awesome."}, {"text": " Each side depends on the other, and each is relative to the other\u2014every action has an equal and opposite reaction\u2014so the more you give, the more you receive. And vice versa. You may be thinking, that\u2019s so not true, I know some bitches who do nothing but take and haven\u2019t given a damn thing to anybody, ever, but receiving has a different energy than selfishly taking, just as smothering has a different energy than giving."}, {"text": " Smothering  \fand taking are fear-based and needy, giving and receiving are full of gratitude and surrendering to the flow. I know someone who has multiple sclerosis who was told by a mentor to give away twenty-nine things for twentynine days as part of her cure.

If you want to attract good things and feelings into your life, send awesomeness out to everyone around you. Here are some good ways to get in the give-and-take flow, yo: 1. If you haven\u2019t already, pick one or two causes that have real meaning to you and give to them every month."}, {"text": " Give however much time or money you can, but do it consistently so it becomes a habit, so it becomes part  \fof who you are.

And if you can, do it without them knowing where it came from."}, {"text": " 3. Leave a dollar more than you normally would every time you tip. Or ten. 4. If someone is being snarky, instead of sinking to their level and being snarky back, raise them up by giving them the love.  \f5. Smile, compliment, and crack people up as often as possible. 6. Say yes to invitations that you wouldn\u2019t normally say yes to because you hate to inconvenience the person offering."}, {"text": " Take them up on it. Give them the opportunity to give to you. 7. Stop and feel in your body how great it feels when you give and receive; raise your frequency and expect more good things to come your way.  8.

It was as unthinkable to me at the time as saying  \fthe F-word or sitting down to join my parents for a glass of scotch."}, {"text": " My amazement quickly turned to horror when I realized it wasn\u2019t just that one renegade friend who could answer the phone in such a carefree manner, but everyone, and that my parents were clearly playing some big practical joke on us.

I don\u2019t remember exactly when the mutiny happened, but eventually we all started answering the phone like normal  \fhuman beings.

Hello? Which is why it completely baffles me when anyone over the age of five is rude, and especially when they refrain from the thank-you part of the conversation when a gesture is made on their behalf, either by me or other people or The Universe in general."}, {"text": " I don\u2019t know about you, but when someone doesn\u2019t say thank you after I\u2019ve hooked them up, it\u2019s as glaring an omission to me as if they\u2019ve shown up without their pants on. And The  \fUniverse feels the same way.  You cut yourself off from the supply of awesomeness when you are not in a state of gratitude."}, {"text": " Having gratitude goes way beyond just having good manners, however. Manners are a form of custom, gratitude is a state of being. Anyone can whip out their P\u2019s and Q\u2019s whether they\u2019re feeling  \fit or not, but truly being in a state of gratitude is about having an awareness of, and a deep appreciation for, the many miracles in your life."}, {"text": " Think about how it feels when you get to really thank someone for doing something for you. You feel great for receiving whatever it is you received and for sending thanks out to them, and they feel great for giving you whatever they gave and for being appreciated. Which makes you feel great again. Which makes them feel great again\u2014you could basically spend the rest of your lives passing thank-you notes back and forth."}, {"text": " And because it makes you feel good to be in such a state of gratitude, it  \fputs you at a very high frequency and connects you to Source Energy, which puts you in a more powerful state to manifest more good feeling things and experiences into your life. Conversely, when you show up disappointed or angry or guilty or oblivious instead of being grateful, you\u2019re at a lower frequency and thereby less connected to Source Energy and in a less powerful state to manifest good feeling things and experiences into your life."}, {"text": " So that\u2019s all fabulous and great, but here\u2019s where the whole gratitude thing gets really cool. There are lots of ways to feel good and raise your frequency  \fand get closer to Source Energy, but with gratitude, you\u2019re actually expending positive energy by sending out thanks, which makes positive energy reflect back to you\u2014every action has an equal and opposite reaction."}, {"text": " This makes the manifesting process even more powerful. It\u2019s like the difference between seeing someone fall apart laughing and seeing them fall apart laughing at something you said. The first usually makes you feel as good and laugh as hard as they do, which raises your frequency, but with the second situation, you\u2019re not just meeting them at a high frequency, you\u2019re exchanging energy at  \fa high frequency."}, {"text": " Their laughter is like their way of thanking you for saying something hilarious, and it gives off an even more powerful zing and stronger connection.

When you actively send this grateful energy out, you receive it back, bringing you closer and closer to Source Energy and raising your frequency higher and higher with each  \fexchange until you come to the visceral understanding that you are the same stuff as Source Energy and that you consciously or unconsciously manifested your reality yourself out of the infinite nothingness and everythingness."}, {"text": " Gratitude connects you to the truth that you not only have the power to manifest that which you seek, but you are the power. Which means, in essence, when you are being grateful to Source Energy you are being grateful to yourself. Which brings it back to the most powerful thing of all: Self- love. Tah dah! The more consistently you stay in gratitude and focused on that  \fwhich is good, the stronger your connection to Source Energy is, and the more quickly and effortlessly you\u2019ll be able to manifest that which is unseen into your reality."}, {"text": " This is the almighty power of gratitude. But wait, there\u2019s more! Gratitude also strengthens your faith.  Faith is having the audacity to believe in the not-yet seen.  \fFaith is the muscle you use when you decide to blast outside of your comfort zone and transform your life into something that\u2019s practically unrecognizable to you in your present reality."}, {"text": " Faith smothers your fear of the unknown. Faith allows you to take risks. Faith is the stuff of \u201cleap and the net will appear.\u201d  Faith is your best buddy when you\u2019re scared shitless.  \fWhen you are consistently in a state of gratitude, and aware of all the awesomeness that already exists, it, among many other things, makes it much easier for you to believe that there\u2019s more awesomeness where that came from, and that this yet-to-be-manifested awesomeness is also available to you."}, {"text": " You\u2019ve received awesomeness before, so of course, you can receive awesomeness again.

This takes some Jedi mastery, however, because basically what it entails is not only believing in the not yet manifested (having faith), but being grateful for it. In other words, you must be grateful for your imaginary friends and your imaginary life."}, {"text": " Yep. As ridiculous as this sounds, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re already doing it consciously or  \funconsciously in some capacity in your life. One simple example from my life would be with finding parking spaces.

The perfect spot is mine, it already exists and I\u2019m genuinely so happy and grateful for it."}, {"text": " I really truly believe this. Then, as always, someone  \fpulls out and in I go. Yet as consistently as this happens, I\u2019m still always so excited when it does. I never take it for granted, and I am a gratitude machine before, during, and after my guaranteed excellent parking adventure.  Being in gratitude for the not-yet manifested informs The Universe that you know that what you desire already exists, and puts you at the right frequency to  \freceive it."}, {"text": " If you want to radically change your life, strengthen your faith that we live in an abundant, benevolent Universe by being grateful for everything you\u2019ve already manifested and all the good that\u2019s hurtling toward you.

If you want to get over your issues and rock your life, be grateful, look for the good and learn.  2. WRITE YOUR THANKYOU NOTES Every night before you go to bed, review your day and either write down or mentally note ten things you can be grateful for in your life."}, {"text": " These can be  \feverything from the beautiful flowers in your garden to the fact that your heart is beating to the hour-long visit from your persnickety neighbor that taught you to be happy that you don\u2019t have her life.

When it comes to our emotional pain, however, we\u2019re apparently way more game for seeing just how much torture we can endure, wallowing in our guilt, shame, resentment, and self-loathing, sometimes for entire lifetimes."}, {"text": " We prolong our misery by holding on to our ill feelings by badmouthing our mother  \fin-laws, fantasizing about pantsing our loudmouth, incompetent bosses in front of a the whole office, unloading fault on other people, and rolling around in our minds the many reasons why our enemies are wrong and the many reasons why we\u2019re right."}, {"text": " We relive our worst moments over and over and over instead of letting them go, we pick at the emotional scabs and refuse to let the healing happen and the pain subside. We won\u2019t rest until we\u2019ve made sure someone else feels as badly as they\u2019ve just made us feel. If I have to suffer my entire life I will make sure you see how you\u2019ve wronged me!

Holding on will not change this fact, it will just keep the negative feelings from the past alive, keep you a  \fprisoner to your pain and lower your frequency. The moment you decide to forgive and let your negative feelings melt away, you are on the road to freedom. Forgiveness is all about taking care of you, not the person you need to forgive."}, {"text": " It\u2019s about putting your desire to feel good before your desire to be right. It\u2019s about taking responsibility for your own happiness instead of pretending it\u2019s in somebody else\u2019s hands.

And don\u2019t pretend it\u2019s because you want them to become a better person."}, {"text": " You could care less. You want retribution or an apology or to be acknowledged as right. Get over it.

FIND COMPASSION Finding compassion for yourself or someone else who did something so so  \fso so awful is like pulling a bullet out of your arm: You may kick and scream and hate it at first, but, in the long run, it\u2019s the only way to start the real healing."}, {"text": " One of the best tricks for doing this is to imagine the person you\u2019re resentful of as a little kid.

People act poorly because they are in pain or confused or both."}, {"text": " Understanding this, and imagining the person who you want to behead as a sweet little innocent child with big puppy dog eyes, will help you find compassion for them, which is the key to  \fforgiveness.

Another option is to picture yourself hanging out in your brand new boat and an empty boat floats up and bangs into you, leaving a scratch."}, {"text": " If there\u2019s nobody in the boat, there\u2019s nobody to get mad at  \fand you deal with the situation in a much calmer, inquisitive way.

When someone does something awful to you, take that person out of the equation so you can open yourself up to have a more pleasant, and productive, reaction (and life). It\u2019s not about them anyway, it\u2019s about you."}, {"text": " If you have nobody to be angry at, it\u2019s hard to be angry. Instead, it opens the incident up  \ffor questioning. Why did this happen? How was I involved? Why did I attract this to myself? How can I grow from this? How can I find compassion for everyone involved?

After a glorious drive beneath the endless New Mexico sky and a beautiful hike on a red dirt path through a pi\u00f1on pine forest, we got to The Cave. It was just as she\u2019d described: a little hole at  \fthe base of a small hill just big enough to crawl through."}, {"text": " My friend tossed me a pair of knee pads and a flashlight and headed in. I followed her on my hands and knees, holding my flashlight with my teeth, and by the time we were about ten minutes in, I felt like the entrance, and my chances of ever seeing another burger again, had vanished. If anything came at us from inside the cave, like, say, a monster, or if there was a flash flood or an earthquake or a rattlesnake or a mosquito, we were totally screwed."}, {"text": " The craggy white rock tunnel surrounding us had closed in so tightly that when my friend finally stopped crawling and leaned against the wall to  \fsit, she had to do so with her head bent so far forward it looked like she was about to start chewing on her neck.

BE IN THE MOMENT  \fIs anything scary happening to you right now at this very moment? Right now, where you\u2019re sitting, is anything bad actually happening or is it just the thoughts in your head that are freaking you out? You deplete the much-needed energy you need to kick ass by freaking out before something even happens."}, {"text": " Instead, stay in the moment and connect to your higher self.

CUT OFF THE STREAM OF CRAP Be more conscious of the information you absorb. What blogs do you read? What shows do you watch? What books do you read? What stories do you read in the paper? What movies do you go to? Whose opinion do you ask? What do you focus on in your day-to-day life?

And the things that stand out the most to us are the things that remind us the most of ourselves.

The people you surround yourself with are excellent mirrors for who you are and  \fhow much, or how little, you love yourself. We attract people into our lives for a reason, just as they attract us into theirs.

It\u2019s one thing to kick ass when your back is against the wall and you\u2019ve got to come up with your kid\u2019s tuition, and quite another to create self-imposed urgency so you stay the course until you\u2019ve created your dream life instead of settling back into the Big Snooze."}, {"text": " You need a sense of urgency to keep from  \fdropping the ball when it gets difficult and sliding down into thinking, \u201cAh, screw it, I\u2019m fine living next door to a kennel full of barking dogs.

A great way to psyche yourself into up-leveling is by raising your bottom line. So often we take the massive leaps of faith only when we have to, when we  \fneed to put out some sort of fire aka pay off some huge bill."}, {"text": " Because this is about changing you, not just about changing your income, why not decide to be the kind of person who always has a certain amount of money in the bank?

It\u2019s only when you stop trying so desperately, relax, breathe, and surrender your desire to The Universe that the butterfly of your dreams calmly comes and lands on your nose.

This doesn\u2019t mean that we give up or discontinue taking  \faction. This means we let go energetically, release our kung fu grip and create some space for what we want to come to us. It\u2019s about allowing instead of forcing.

BREATHE AMONGST THE PEOPLE Your superhero power, i.e. your connection to Source Energy, is available to you 24/7, not only when you\u2019re sitting cross-legged in your robe meditating. Once you get your brain used to shutting up and tuning into Source  \fEnergy, you can start doing it throughout your day."}, {"text": " The whole point of everything you\u2019ve learned in this book is to use it to improve your life, not to take a break, go off and read, and then head back out to live your life again and leave everything you\u2019ve learned back there, on the couch, where you were reading.

SET HONEST GOALS Don\u2019t decide you\u2019re going to run ten miles a day when you still consider walking to the pizza parlor around the corner a day\u2019s worth of exercise.

BOOKS  \fAsk and It is Given: Learning to Manifest Your Desires by Esther and Jerry Hicks This is an excellent starter book. Well-written and not hellishly long, it talks all about the Law of Attraction in depth and how to manifest what you want into your life."}, {"text": " The Freak Factor is super high: co-author Esther Hicks was your average housewife until she suddenly started channeling this spirit named Abraham.

The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom by Don Miguel Ruiz Good, short, based on the wisdom passed down from the author\u2019s Toltec ancestors.

The Game of Life and How to Play It by Florence Scovel Shinn This book constantly refers to The Bible and Jesus, but it\u2019s easy to love whether or not you\u2019re religious because it\u2019s crammed full of valuable spiritual lessons and lots and lots of old-timey stories."}, {"text": " The writing is real pedestrian and very grandmotherly, but I love the simplicity and how well the stories illustrate what she\u2019s talking about.

The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment by Eckhart Tolle If you\u2019re new to the whole Ego (or Big Snooze) thing and really want to grasp the transformative nature of being present, this is basically The Bible."}, {"text": " It challenges you to see the world in a different way and does a great job of at helping you grasp some pretty deep theories about reality and time and perspective. This is another one where the Freak Factor is very high: Eckhart was suicidal, all ready to do himself in and then woke up one morning all  \fenlightened and transformed and was in such a state of bliss that he spent the next two years sitting on a park bench, playing with his lip (I\u2019m not kidding)."}, {"text": " Then he channeled this book. As a Man Thinketh by James Allen This is, shockingly all about the mighty mind and how to use it to master your world. Considering the fact that if you can really truly get that skill down, you can create the most awesome life ever, reading this book, over and over and over until it becomes second nature is time well spent."}, {"text": " It\u2019s another old-timey one written back in ye olde day, but it\u2019s still extremely quotable and relevant  \ftoday.

Losing  My  Virginity:  How  I\u2019ve  \fSurvived, Had Fun and Made a Fortune Doing Business My Way by Richard Branson This is an awesome read\u2014I devoured the whole thing in one sitting."}, {"text": " Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Records and Virgin Airlines, is a maniac and one of the most inspiring people on two legs as far as I\u2019m concerned. The book details his life from when he started his little record shop to becoming one of the most famous and radical entrepreneurs who went on to buy his own island and fly hot air balloons over the ocean in the jet stream."}, {"text": " I would like very much to party with this guy.  \fIMPORTANT BIOGRAPHY NOTE: I\u2019ve listed Richard Branson\u2019s biography because it\u2019s one of my favorites, but pretty much any biography/autobiography about the people you personally find inspiring is totally worth reading. I could list about seventy more here, but you may not find the life and accomplishments of, say, Dolly Parton or Eleanor Roosevelt, as riveting and inspiring as I do."}, {"text": " I strongly suggest you actually take the time to read books about the people who light you up, because it\u2019s one of the best ways to get inspired to change your life. Practical Intuition by Laura Day  \fLong hailed as a leading master of intuition, Laura Day has worked with everyone from high-powered business people to hippies to celebrities to financial analysts to housewives."}, {"text": " She is the queen of showing people how to access their intuition so they can make more informed decisions and design more authentic lives.

The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success: A Practical Guide to the Fulfillment of Your Dreams by Deepak Chopra I\u2019m a huge fan of not having to read  \ftoo much to get the information I want, and of knowing how much I\u2019m gonna have to do ahead of time to get where I want to go."}, {"text": " Good old Deepak breaks achieving success down into seven, easy-to-follow steps based on spiritual principles. This is one of my all-time favorites for its small size and profoundly potent advice. It delivers deeply spiritual and powerful information in bite-sized chunks and gives clear exercises on using it in your everyday life to achieve what you want."}, {"text": " You Can Heal Your Life by Louise Hay Louise Hay is a modern day self-help pioneer who cured herself of cancer  \fusing her highly-lauded principles of self-love and who now has her own empire with a publishing company and everything. This book is one of my faves, even though it\u2019s SUPER woowoo, full of affirmations and general gooeyness, but in the ever-critical selflove department, it doesn\u2019t get any better than this."}, {"text": " The back of the book is all about the body and how all our injuries and dis-eases can be traced back to negative thought patterns. So if you break your leg, you can look it up and see that it\u2019s because you\u2019re scared of moving forward (or something, don\u2019t quote me on that) and get an affirmation from Louise on how to heal yourself."}, {"text": " I  \fhave a friend who completely cured himself of something the doctors were baffled by through reading this book and doing what it says. Creating Money: Keys To Abundance by Sanaya Roman and Duane Packer The title of this book is a tad misleading because it\u2019s about so much more than money, yet since most people want to make more money, the good news is they\u2019ll pick it up and get way more than they bargained for by reading it and doing what it says."}, {"text": " While it does indeed teach you how to create money, it also gives clear instruction on meditation, clearing blocks, manifesting,  \fworking with energy, gaining clarity, etc. All of which contribute to manifesting money, as well as pretty much everything else, into your life. Easy to read and follow with simple exercises and deceptively deep concepts broken down, this is an awesome starter book as well as one to always have around to provide important reminders and re-alignment."}, {"text": " The Science Of Getting Rich by Wallace D. Wattles The very first sentence of this book made me slam it shut and leave it untouched for years. It reads: \u201cWhatever may be said in praise of poverty, the fact remains that it is not possible to live a  \freally complete or successful life unless one is rich."}, {"text": "\u201d Hello? How gross is that?! It offended me to my hippie core, until I understood what it was really saying and that, erm, you kind of can\u2019t \u2014not if you want to fully express yourself, anyway. \u201cRich\u201d simply means that you have everything you need to share your gifts fully with the world and stay at the highest vibration while you do it, whatever that looks like for you."}, {"text": " This is now easily the book I recommend to people the most, and the one I read over and over. But you have to let a lot go because it will absolutely go up your nose if you\u2019re still working on your issues around it being okay to make  \fmoney. Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill This is the other contender for the \u201cBest Wealth Consciousness Book Ever,\u201d and another old-timey one."}, {"text": " I forgot to mention that Wallace Wattle\u2019s book is old-timey, too, but hello, look at the guy\u2019s name. Anyway, Napoleon Hill interviewed the most successful businessmen at the time to gather the information for this incredible, how-to guide. I read this book over and over, too. It\u2019s very to the point, a total asskicker, and breaks everything down into simple, easy-to-follow instructions."}, {"text": " Do  \fwhat he says (and really do all of it) and you will be large and in charge. Finding Your Own North Star: Claiming the Life You Were Meant to Live by Martha Beck I\u2019ve seen Martha speak and have read lots of her work and really love her voice\u2014so refreshing and brilliant and hilarious. This book is awesome, really walks you through some good steps and asks some great questions to get you the clarity you seek."}, {"text": " She\u2019s big on looking past just what\u2019s going on in your head and connecting with your body to get clarity and guidance from there as well. She\u2019s had a super successful coaching  \finstitute for ages and is one of my favorites in the field. Getting to I Do: The Secret to Doing Relationships Right by Dr."}, {"text": " Patricia Allen I\u2019m pretty sure I tore the cover off this one before carrying it around, but in spite of its totally unforgivable title, there are some real eye-openers in here about the nature of men and women and how differently we go about relationships. Written for women by someone who has coached thousands of happy couples into long-term relationships, it\u2019s full of brilliant insights and tips on how to find and be in  \fthe relationship of your dreams."}, {"text": " As with all this stuff, there will probably be parts you don\u2019t agree with (she\u2019s like a strict Christian mother on the sex issue), but it\u2019s got lots of very valuable information and is definitely worth a read by both men and women. Loving What Is: Four Questions That Can Change Your Life by Byron Katie Read this book! I demand it."}, {"text": " It is the Holy Grail of being happy in your relationships. Based on what Katie calls \u201cThe Work\u201d\u2014which is essentially just asking yourself four simple, yet profound, questions\u2014 this book spends about ten pages walking you through the  \fsteps of The Work and a couple hundred on case studies. It\u2019s basically like watching Katie perform her magic on all sorts of people, from those who\u2019ve been brutally raped to people who\u2019ve lost their children to those who want happier marriages."}, {"text": " She walks them through her process and they suddenly find peace and freedom. It\u2019s so cool AND The Work is a piece of cake. When you read it, I recommend reading the case studies first and then doing The Work on yourself instead of the other way around. Seeing her do it over and over will make it much easier for you to get better results when you try it on yourself."}, {"text": "  \fThe Way of the Superior Man: A Spiritual Guide to Mastering the Challenges of Women, Work and Sexual Desire by David Deida This book is made for a man, but the ladies must read it, too, if they really want to understand how men work. I thought it was brilliant and fascinating and explained SO much about the opposite sex that made me respect men even more."}, {"text": " And the guys I\u2019ve suggested it to said it was massively empowering. It speaks to, and explains, the highest version of masculinity, reminding us ladies why we love the fellas so much and reminding men how truly awesome  \fthey are/can be.  \fSEMINARS PAX\u2014Allison Armstrong I took one of their brilliant seminars for women called \u201cUnderstanding Men, Celebrating Women,\u201d all about the difference between the sexes that had me on the floor\u2014how did I make it this far and not know any of this? I thought it was so well done and not even that cheesy."}, {"text": " I went to just that one seminar but I highly enjoyed their recordings as well and have heard great things about their other workshops.  \fThe Hoffman Institute Kay, so, this is the full-on, are-youfucking-kidding-me one. This involves beating pillows with baseball bats while shrieking at the top of your lungs, marrying yourself, singing lullabies to your inner child\u2014basically everything that would have most people running for their lives."}, {"text": " It was so over the top that you couldn\u2019t help but give into it because what the hell else could you do? Luckily, it\u2019s run by incredibly sweet and skilled people who also have excellent senses of humor about what they\u2019re asking you to do and you spend a solid week of nonstop seminar and digging deep into your past and your limiting  \fbeliefs and letting them go."}, {"text": " It\u2019s like a limiting-belief high-colonic. I loved it as much as I hated it and highly, highly recommend it. Brilliant and transformative (and the food was awesome). Other good speakers to keep an eye out for: Martha Beck, Esther Hicks, Marianne Williamson, Byron Katie, Wayne Dyer, David Neagle, Deepak Chopra, Gabrielle Bernstien."}]
