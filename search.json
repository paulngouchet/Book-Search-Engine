Gordon Mathews considers this perennial issue by examining nine pairs of similarly situated individuals in the United States and Japan. In the course of exploring how people from these two cultures find meaning in their daily lives, he illuminates a vast and intriguing range of ideas about work and love, religion, creativity, and self-realization. Mathews explores these topics by means of the Japanese term ikigai, \"that which most makes one's life seem worth living.\" American English has no equivalent, but ikigai applies not only to Japanese lives but to American lives as well. Ikigai is what, day after day and year after year, each of us most essentially lives for. Through the life stories of those he interviews, Mathews analyzes the ways Japanese and American lives have been affected by social roles and cultural vocabularies.

Walker - Life! Why We Exist... and What We Must Do to Survive - Have you ever wondered why we're here, what it all means? In Life! Why We Exist. And What We Must Do to Survive, Martin Walker reveals that the laws of space and time shape our form and purpose, and that by acting on this purpose we can ensure the continued survival of life on earth. Life! guides us toward the inescapable conclusion that life's persistence is our number-one goal; this goal not only shapes everything we do, think, and feel, but holds our future in the balance. With its compelling and fascinating description of the origins of morality, spirituality, politics, and love, Life! stands on its own as a work of great literature. In its contribution to human understanding, it is the most important book since Darwin's The Origin of Species. Why do we exist? Why does anything exist? Rationalists would argue that the answer lies in a complete and comprehensive understanding of the physical aspects of the universe. Those with a more spiritual outlook might claim that science only tells part of the story, that the ultimate answer rests on faith. And philosophers may raise an eyebrow at any attempt to achieve an ultimate answer. But what if we were to trace a path from the origins of the universe to the present day, examining how the forms of existence have appeared and developed over time, would we be able to discern some pattern and purpose that is otherwise obscure? Martin Walker has spent his life seeking to understand why things are the way they are. Martin studied Physics at St. John's College, Oxford, and now lives in Brooklyn, New York, with his wife, Hope, his daughter, Dorothy, and his son, Zane. The idea that the meaning of life can be found in the fundamental principles of existence came to him during a waking dream on a trans-Atlantic flight. Martin did not rest until he had uncovered the principles that shape our dreams, hopes and fears. In Life!, he shares the fruits of his discovery. Part scientist, part philosopher, part poet, Martin succeeds in bridging the gap between science and spirituality in prose that is compelling, inspirational, and seductive.", "authors": "Martin G.

Or Something Else? The surprise is that you can know the truth about life and be 100% confident in that knowledge. You will know what is on the other side of death. Amazingly, your success or failure in life has to do with your attitude. The person with the \u201cwrong\u201d attitude can read, see, hear the truth and deny it vehemently, while the person with right attitude will understand, appreciate and believe the truth. Life is a perfect and difficult test. The process of life itself sorts out good from evil, right from wrong and you will succeed or fail depending on your attitude. The book defines the attitude you need to succeed and provides evidence and examples to convince. What is life really all about? It may be true that most people do not care, but what is the reason for \u201cnot caring?\u201d Generally, it is because people DOUBT ANYONE REALLY KNOWS, and thus why should anyone care. In addition, the world brings great confusion to this subject. There are scams and frauds around every corner, and even \u201chonest people\u201d push the limits of the truth with exaggeration \u2013 which is really a lie. Greed, selfishness, covetousness, envy, and power are behind a lot of the deceit. The wonder of heaven will provide infinitely more than people could ever achieve on earth, but people want everything NOW and deceit is a frequent companion to achieving earthly desires. There are 45 chapters in the book, \u201cWhat Is Life All About\u201d and then some extensive helpful appendices \u2013 another 163 pages. The single most influential deceit is in the area of religion. The single most prominent reason for being an atheist or agnostic is religion. The past 2000 years of religious history includes unspeakable cruelty, wars, terrorism, indoctrination, lies and deception and this rightly leads to opposition, but also strangely to acceptance/indifference/excuses by others. The critical missing fact is that God had nothing to do with these religions \u2013 but abhors them. What a pathetic assumption to blame God. The truth about God and these religious groups could quickly clarify the situation. Chapter 16 is a chapter that begins to sort out HOW all this religious mess occurred. Here is a partial outline for chapter 16: 16.1 What Is Seriously Wrong with Judaism? 16.2 What Is Seriously Wrong with Roman Catholicism? 16.3 What Is Seriously Wrong with Protestant Groups? 16.4 What Is Seriously Wrong with Islam? 16.5 What Is Seriously Wrong with Mormonism? 16.6 What Is Seriously Wrong with the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses? 16.7 What Is Seriously Wrong with Atheism/Agnosticism? \u201cSeriously Wrong\u201d means there is NO eternal value in these religions. These belief systems were the fabrication of men and/or women and did NOT come from God. The evidence is overwhelming and deceit runs through these religions like vultures going through a carcass. You do not need a forensic analysis, but you can do a complete autopsy if you wish. The damaging evidence regarding these groups is clearly seen and very logical and understandable from the book. This is because AS YOU UNDERSTAND GOD (a significant subject in the book) you do not need to go very far into these beliefs to see huge problems. One of the attitudes you need is a LOVE OF THE TRUTH more than the love of what you currently believe. You can understand God, His purpose, His plan inasmuch as He has revealed Himself. Incredibly, one major obstacle to overcome will be the MAGNITUDE OF THE DECEIT. Lies on top of lies often for many centuries define today\u2019s religions. Religion has become \u201cman\u2019s idea of God\u201d and there is no consistency, just random unrelated doctrines. The truth is infinitely different with everything perfectly connected to a single purpose. Ultimately, your success or failure in life is simply a matter of where you place your trust. Is your trust in God or is it in men/women, who say they are telling you", "authors": "Alan P.

If it were only possible to render them in such a way that I could easily read myself and that others could read me as I do. . .\" Such was the desire of the young Tolstoy. Although he knew that this narrative utopia\u2014turning the totality of his life into a book\u2014would remain unfulfilled, Tolstoy would spend the rest of his life attempting to achieve it. \"Who, What Am I?\" is an account of Tolstoy's lifelong attempt to find adequate ways to represent the self, to probe its limits and, ultimately, to arrive at an identity not based on the bodily self and its accumulated life experience. This book guides readers through the voluminous, highly personal nonfiction writings that Tolstoy produced from the 1850s until his death in 1910. The variety of these texts is enormous, including diaries, religious tracts, personal confessions, letters, autobiographical fragments, and the meticulous accounts of dreams. For Tolstoy, inherent in the structure of the narrative form was a conception of life that accorded linear temporal order a predominant role, and this implied finitude. He refused to accept that human life stopped with death and that the self was limited to what could be remembered and told. In short, his was a philosophical and religious quest, and he followed in the footsteps of many, from Plato and Augustine to Rousseau and Schopenhauer. In reconstructing Tolstoy's struggles, this book reflects on the problems of self and narrative as well as provides an intellectual and psychological biography of the writer.", "authors": "Irina Paperno", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_OGpBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "title": "\"Who, What Am I?\""}, {"text": "Hans K\u00fcng - What I Believe - After two volumes of autobiography, Hans Kung now writes a short personal statement of his Christian belief.", "authors": "Hans K\u00fcng", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QI1EmUF3Go4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "title": "What I Believe"}, {"text": "Dan Burnett - I Am Cxo, Now What? - I Am CXO, Now What? is the apex of Dan Burnetts journey from the child of a grocer to a meandering teen, unaware young adult, maturing man, and eventually a self-actualizing Christian.

According to this view, the happier a person is, the better off he is. The doctrine is controversial in part because the nature of happiness is controversial. In What Is This Thing Called Happiness? Fred Feldman presents a study of the nature and value of happiness. Part One contains critical discussions of the main philosophical and psychological theories of happiness. Feldman presents arguments designed to show that each of these theories is problematic. Part Two contains his presentation and defense of his own theory of happiness, which is a form of attitudinal hedonism. On this view, a person's level of happiness may be identified with the extent to which he or she takes pleasure in things. Feldman shows that if we understand happiness as he proposes, it becomes reasonable to suppose that a person's well-being is determined by his or her level of happiness. This view has important implications not only for moral philosophy, but also for the emerging field of hedonic psychology.

Everybody is on a happiness quest. For many, happiness is measured in moments. Experiences. It's elusive. Unsustainable. What about you? What makes you happy? Something comes to mind for each of us. In this six-session video Bible study, pastor Andy Stanley examines the ways in which we tend to define happiness and explains how that definition influences the way we pursue it. He reveals that happiness is about who, not what, and that happy people are at peace with God, with others, and with themselves. He also shows how sin undermines peace because it separates us from God, others, and ourselves by substituting pleasure for fulfillment, things for people, images for intimacy, and self-expression for self-control. We are often tempted to believe that happiness comes from acquiring things, but happiness is actually an outcome of what we sow in our lives. We can\u2019t acquire, consume, or exercise our way to happiness, but we may be able to serve and volunteer our way there. In the end, we find that if we live as if it\u2019s all about us, we will never be happy.

In The Unbelievable Happiness of What Is, a contemporary spiritual teacher in the non-duality tradition reveals how confronting and letting go of our negative beliefs about ourselves and the world ultimately sets us on the path toward an awakened life of profound joy, meaning, and purpose. We all want peace and freedom and love and happiness, we all want to be fulfilled, but so many of us fail to reach the level of contentment we\u2019ve built up in our minds, often believing there\u2019s something wrong with us and blaming ourselves, others, or circumstances for our perceived lack of accomplishment or satisfaction. But the truth is, happiness is not something you have to get or achieve, because it\u2019s something you already have\u2014in fact, it\u2019s what you already are. With this book, author Jon Bernie\u2014counselor, healer, and teacher in the lineage of Adyashanti\u2014sheds light on the struggle to find happiness, showing how our unexamined beliefs distort our identities and make us suffer by creating unconscious tension in our bodies and minds.

Within these pages Monica Belizan shares a clear and enjoyable Program that will lead you to understand what happiness is in all its depth, and, even more importantly, it will teach you how to merge with it and live from it. The Program is deceptively simple. One Principle a week, practiced a few minutes a day, begins the journey to a more peaceful, joyful, creative version of yourself. Each Principle illuminates the path to your true core. And the practices that follow them instill in you new consciously chosen habits that lay down an immutable foundation of happiness in you and your life. You will gain clarity and focus and you will align with your unbreakable essence. Gently but surely you will become freer and freer from desperation, drama and fear, and as you do so, your transformation will ripple out, impacting the life of those close to you and beyond. If you keep an open mind, if you just follow the instructions and commit to the practices, happiness will become the backdrop of all the experiences in your lifeeven when your heart is broken, when someone you love is diagnosed with an incurable illness, when you are alone, when you are broke.

In What Keeps Me Standing, he turns to another group of sages and mentors: the grandmothers who have long been the backbone of the African American family and community. Over a period of five years, Kimbro contacted one thousand grandmothers--women from a wide range of backgrounds and locations--asking, \"If you had to write a one page letter to your children or the next generation, what would you tell them about life?\" Their answers, collected here, show that success in life cannot be measured in terms of wealth and material goods alone. The lives they describe and the advice they proffer capture both a richness in spirit and a strong belief in the power of every individual to take charge of his or her own destiny. In the face of racism, both blatant and subtle, financial struggles, and personal setbacks, black grandmothers have helped their communities in thousands of tangible and intangible ways, providing support, inspiration, and love not only to their own children and grandchildren but also to neighbors, friends, and extended families.

African-Caribbean families appeared as the mirror opposite of the \"ideal\" family advocated by the white, colonial authorities. Yet contrary to this image, what provided continuity in the period and contributed to survival was in fact the strength of family connections, their inclusivity and support. This study is based on 150 life story narratives across three generations of forty-five families who originated in the former British West Indies. The author focuses on the particular axes of Caribbean peoples from the former British colonies of Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados, and Great Britain. Divided into four parts, the chapters within each present an oral history of migrant African-Caribbean families, demonstrating the varieties, organization, and dynamics of family through their memories and narratives. It traces the evolution of Caribbean life; argues how the family can be seen as the tool that helps transmit and transform historical mentalities; examines the dynamics of family life; and makes comparisons with Indo-Caribbean families. Above all, this is a story of families that evolved, against the odds of slavery and poverty, to form a distinct Creole form, through which much of the social history of the English-speaking Caribbean is refracted. Family Love in the Diaspora offers an important new perspective on African-Caribbean families, their history, and the problems they face, for now and the future. It offers a long overdue historical dimension to the debates on Caribbean families. Mary Chamberlain is professor of modern social history at Oxford Brookes University, in the United Kingdom.

Marriage is a vocation, vocation means a calling from God, in another word you are called to love your spouse to consecrate your life to your partner, to commit, with intimacy, and passion.

But the guys are very physical, they have strength, discipline, smart, more logical. Looking at it they are quite different but they were created to complete each other, they will get together and create one human being.

It argues that they should be understood as forms of interplay between the subjective and the objective, necessity and contingency and unity and difference. A comprehensive elaboration of these forms is to be found in Hegel\u00bfs Science of Logic\u00bfthe conclusions of which he used to organise his ethical and political thought. The argument is introduced with a discussion of the relevance of Hegel\u00bfs speculative philosophy to modernity. The authors then explore the relationship between thought, being and recognition in Hegel\u00bfs philosophical system and offer an interpretation of the Science of Logic. This interpretation forms the basis of a re-assessment of Hegel\u00bfs treatment of love, sexual relationships, the family and law. A Hegelian account of familial love is employed to review recent debates within a range of discourses, including feminism, family law and gay and lesbian studies. As well as addressing current concerns about sexual difference and the ontology of homosexuality, the study provides a guide to reading Hegel in an original and productive way. It will be of interest to philosophers, feminists, theorists of sexualities, ethical and legal theorists.", "authors": "Toula Nicolacopoulos", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CtsJ9Q1cwj0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "title": "Hegel and the Logical Structure of Love"}, {"text": "Michael Kaufman - Love, Marriage, and Family in Jewish Law and Tradition - A comprehensive exploration of love, marriage, and human sexuality as viewed by Jewish tradition, presenting the richness and profundity of Jewish wisdom regarding human relationships.

When frustrated with an unresponsive child, a parent doesn\u2019t declare, \u201cYou don\u2019t love me.\u201d Instead the parent asserts, \u201cYou are being disrespectful right now.\u201d A parent needs to feel respected, especially during conflicts. When upset a child does not whine, \u201cYou don\u2019t respect me.\u201d Instead, a child pouts, \u201cYou don\u2019t love me.\u201d A child needs to feel loved, especially during disputes. But here\u2019s the rub: An unloved child (or teen) negatively reacts in a way that feels disrespectful to a parent. A disrespected parent negatively reacts in a way that feels unloving to the child. This dynamic gives birth to the FAMILY CRAZY CYCLE. So how is one to break out of this cycle? Best-selling author Emerson Eggerichs has studied the family dynamic for more than 30 years, having his Ph.D. in Child and Family Ecology. As a senior pastor for nearly two decades, Eggerichs builds on a foundation of strong biblical principles, walking the reader through an entirely new way to approach the family dynamic. For instance, God reveals ways to defuse the craziness with our children from preschooler to teen, plus how to motivate them to obey and how to deal with them when they don\u2019t.

With the global spread of capitalist production and neo-liberal ideologies, the claim that the rest of the world\u2019s women are treading the path to enlightenment and development forged by women in the West has been revived. This book explores that contention through a comparative analysis of the attitudes of young middle class urbanites in ten countries: the USA, Australia, Canada, Japan, Thailand, South Korea, India, Indonesia, China and Vietnam. Drawing on detailed empirical research, the study describes and compares attitudes towards the women\u2019s movement, sexual relations and family arrangements in the countries considered. It explores young peoples\u2019 image of feminists and what they feel the women\u2019s movement has achieved for women and men in their country. The book discusses young people\u2019s attitudes to controversial gender issues such as role reversal, sharing housework, abortion rights, same sex sexual relations, nudity and pornography. Through a comparative analysis of the gender vocabularies by which young people understand gender issues, the book highlights the role of differences in history, culture, economics and political leadership. These influence attitudes to gender relations, the status of women and the political programs of the women\u2019s movement in different countries.

Whether motivated by violent conquest, economics, lust, or love, such unions have disturbed some of America's most sacred beliefs and prejudices. Sex, Love, Race provides a historical foundation for contemporary discussions of sex across racial lines, which, despite the numbers of interracial marriages and multiracial children, remains a controversial issue today. The first historical anthology to focus solely and widely on the subject, Sex, Love, Race gathers new essays by both younger and well-known scholars which probe why and how the specter of sex across racial boundaries has so threatened Americans of all colors and classes. Traversing the whole of American history, from liaisons among Indians, Europeans, and Africans to twentieth-century social scientists' fascination with sex between \"Orientals\" and whites, the essays cover a range of regions, races, ethnicities, and sexual orientations. In so doing, Sex, Love, Race, sketches a larger portrait of the overlapping construction of racial, ethnic, and sexual identities in America.", "authors": "Martha Hodes", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NToTCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "title": "Sex, Love, Race"}, {"text": "Michael Cart - Love & Sex - Covering an array of topics and situations, a collection of stories about love and sex includes works by Joan Bauer, Angela Johnson, Chris Lynch, Garth Nix, and Laurie Halse Anderson.", "authors": "Michael Cart", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YacdO9uZshEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "title": "Love & Sex"}, {"text": "Alan Soble - Sex, Love, and Friendship - This collection joins together sixty essays on the philosophy of love and sex.

Sex, Love, and Migration takes as its subject the lives of post-Soviet migrant women employed in three distinct spheres\u2014sex work, the garment trade, and domestic work.

It\u2019s no wonder we humans struggle to understand its meaning and purpose. It can be difficult to talk about and even worse if we have experienced unwanted shame or grew up in a home where sex was a taboo topic. In Love & Sex, Nancy Houston provides a compassionate view of human sexuality. Through the lens of Scripture, she unpacks the good God intended when he created humans as sexual creatures and honestly shows how that plan hasn\u2019t been the case for many. You won\u2019t find a critical examination of dos and don\u2019ts but stories of redemption, grace, and hope. You will understand how you were shaped and how you are more than your sexual behaviors.

Taken largely from her private lessons to her sisters, published here for the first time, Where There is Love, There is God unveils her extraordinary faith in and surrender to God\u2019s will. This book is in some way a sequel to Mother Teresa: Come Be My Light, in which her own very private spiritual struggles were explained. Sent to alleviate the sufferings of the poor, she assumed their struggles and pain in the depths of her heart. This led to particularly intense anguish which she lived through with heroic courage and fidelity over several decades. As important as this aspect of her life is, that remarkable testimony of her life and her words intensifies the need and desire to know more of her thought. There is much she can teach us as we face our daily struggles or sufferings, which can at times be unusually severe. Where There is Love, There is God, though not an exhaustive anthology of Mother Teresa\u2019s teaching, nonetheless shows what she believed and taught about important issues that confront all people. Due to her constant interaction with people of diverse backgrounds, no life situation was foreign to her and in this book her role is primarily one of teacher and guide. Love is perhaps the word that best summarizes Mother Teresa\u2019s life and message. The title reflects what she proclaimed during her entire life: God is alive, present, and \u201cstill loves the world through you and through me\u201d. Mother Teresa sought to be an extension of God\u2019s heart and hands in the world of today. She was called to be a missionary of charity, a carrier of God\u2019s love to each person she met, especially those most in need. Yet she did not think that this was a vocation uniquely hers; each person is in some way called to be a carrier of God\u2019s love. Through the practical and timely advice she offers, Mother Teresa sets us on the path to closer union with God and greater love for our brothers and sisters. MOTHER TERESA (1910\u20131997) was born in Skopje (present-day Macedonia), and joined the Sisters of Loreto in Dublin in 1928. She left the Loreto order in 1948 to begin the Missionaries of Charity in Calcutta. Her service to the poorest of the poor became her life\u2019s work. She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 and was beatified in 2003.

The focus here is not so much on the myriad symbolic values and associations of Beatrice and Laura but rather both on the attitudes of these two poets to sexual desire in order to throw some light on the character of their human love and on the status and value they give to human love in the context of their Christian lives.For all the stark contrasts between them, Dante and Petrarch have been often compared, for they write in a common literary, classical, and Christian tradition. The comparison generally leads to the conclusion that Dante describes his human love experience as positive and constructive whilst Petrarch's experience of love is negative and destructive. My intention here is not to polarize their views in this way, but rather to identify the different yet positive and highly original value both poets attribute to human love. More than fifty years ago, Etienne Gilson claimed that Peter Abelard turned to loving God in the way that Heloise had loved him, with the disinterestedness which she claimed in loving him and which she accused him of never understanding in loving her. It is the general argument of this study that Dante and Petrarch, as well as leaving their original mark on the treatment of love in literature, have insights into religion, personal to them, which can be likewise characterized by examining their attitude to human love and the story of their personal loves. There are many more aspects to their Catholicism than are examined in these essays. The discussion here is of that part of their faith which grows out of, is coloured by, or at least can be explored, through their human loving.", "authors": "Pamela Williams", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hZn-B6wIcgMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "title": "Through Human Love to God"}, {"text": "Christopher W.

Peckham - The Love of God - 2015 Readers' Choice Award Winner \"For God so loved the world . . .\" We believe these words, but what do they really mean? Does God choose to love, or does God love necessarily? Is God's love emotional? Does the love of God include desire or enjoyment? Is God's love conditional? Can God receive love from human beings? Attempts to answer these questions have produced sharply divided pictures of God's relationship to the world. One widely held position is that of classical theism, which understands God as necessary, self-sufficient, perfect, simple, timeless, immutable and impassible. In this view, God is entirely unaffected by the world and his love is thus unconditional, unilateral and arbitrary. In the twentieth century, process theologians replaced classical theism with an understanding of God as bound up essentially with the world and dependent on it. In this view God necessarily feels all feelings and loves all others, because they are included within himself. In The Love of God, John Peckham offers a comprehensive canonical interpretation of divine love in dialogue with, and at times in contrast to, both classical and process theism. God's love, he argues, is freely willed, evaluative, emotional and reciprocal, given before but not without conditions. According to Peckham's reading of Scripture, the God who loves the world is both perfect and passible, both self-sufficient and desirous of reciprocal relationships with each person, so that \"whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have eternal life.\"", "authors": "John C.

Jones - The Evangelistic Love of God and Neighbor - There are, it seems, as many definitions of the term \"evangelism\" as there are people doing the defining. For some, it means proclaiming the gospel to those who have not heard it. To others, it means making disciples of Jesus Christ. To others, it means working for the transformation of the world into the kingdom of God. For still others, it has principally to do with building vibrant, healthy congregations. Underlying this confusion is a fundamental inability to locate the practice of evangelism within one's overall theological convictions. We will never understand the part that proclamation, disciple making, kingdom building, and church growth play in evangelism until we first ask a more important question: What does evangelism have to do with who God is? What is it we know about God that makes evangelism a central part of what it means to be Christian? In this comprehensive theology of evangelism, Scott J. Jones proposes to ground the practice of evangelism in an understanding of God's love for the world, specifically as seen in the incarnation of God in Christ. In Jesus, God took on all of what it means to be human. Because of this, evangelism must be a ministry to the whole person. The typical distinctions between soul-winning, social action, and church growth evaporate; individual conversion and acts of mercy are part of the same ministry of bringing persons more fully into the reign of a loving God.", "authors": "Scott J.

Sternberg gives us new answers to these questions by showing that the kind of relationship we create depends on the kind of love stories we carry inside us. Drawing on extensive research and fascinating examples of real couples, Sternberg identifies 26 types of love story--including the fantasy story, the business story, the collector story, the horror story, and many others--each with its distinctive advantages and pitfalls, and many of which are clashingly incompatible. These are the largely unconscious preconceptions that guide our romantic choices, and it is only by becoming aware of the kind of story we have about love that we gain the freedom to create more fulfilling and lasting relationships. As long as we remain oblivious to the role our stories play, we are likely to repeat the same mistakes again and again. But the enlivening good news this book brings us is that though our stories drive us, we can revise them and learn to choose partners whose stories are more compatible with our own.

In Sex and Love in Intimate Relationships, Firestone and his coauthors help therapists help their clients. Drawing on their forty years of combined clinical experience and a unique longitudinal study of couples and families, they propose that sexual problems are largely related to defenses acquired through painful childhood experiences. The self-sabotaging effects of this fantasy bond - an illusion of connection to the mother or primary caregiver - give rise to critical internal voices. These voices support negative views of the self and others, interfering with closeness and intimacy. therapy sessions, the authors show how clients can be helped to overcome these challenges and become physically and emotionally closer to their partners.

We don't realize all the ways that our resistance to appreciation, praise, compliments, and accepting help from others hurts us and cripples our relationships. Many partners learn how to give love, but many more undermine their relationships by for-getting something that is equally important -- learning to receive it. According to the authors, the root of the problem is the self-rejection that began in childhood, when our parents and caretakers unintentionally failed to nurture or directly rejected traits, characteristics, or im-pulses when we were children. We end up rejecting in ourselves whatever our caretakers ignored or rejected in the course of our childhoods. When we become adults, this makes it impossible to let in the love we want and need, even when our partners offer it. As a result, we dismiss compliments, minimize gestures of affection, and create obstacles to true intimacy. In this book, Harville Hendrix and Helen LaKelly Hunt, co-creators of Imago Relation-ship Therapy, offer a definitive guide to breaking the shackles of self-rejection and embracing the love our partners offer. Receiving Love is a very personal book for Drs. Hendrix and Hunt, and much of their own journey is the inspiration for it. Drawing on their renowned expertise, the wide clinical experience of hundreds of Imago therapists, and their own personal experience, the authors are able to offer detailed guidance on how to conquer the problems that come from self-rejection and embrace the gifts that are abundant in every person's life, if only we knew how to accept them. With its groundbreaking theory, challenging processes, and inspiring examples, this book holds the key to loving relationships that last.", "authors": "Harville Hendrix", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fg6bdIqvBo0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "title": "Receiving Love"}, {"text": "Gillian Holloway - Complete Dream Book of Love and Relationships - What do your dreams really mean...for your love life?

Why if love is so great and powerful are human relationships so challenging and difficult? If love is the source of happiness and joy, why is it so hard to open to it fully and let it govern our lives? In this book, John Welwood addresses these questions and shows us how to overcome the most fundamental obstacle that keeps us from experiencing love's full flowering in our lives. Perfect Love, Imperfect Relationships begins by showing how all our relational problems arise out of a universal, core wounding around love that affects not only our personal relationships but the quality of life in our world as a whole. This wounding shows up as a pervasive mood of unlove\u2014a deep sense that we are not intrinsically lovable just as we are. And this shuts down our capacity to trust, so that even though we may hunger for love, we have difficulty opening to it and letting it circulate freely through us. This book takes the reader on a powerful journey of healing and transformation that involves learning to embrace our humanness and appreciate the imperfections of our relationships as trail-markers along the path to great love. It sets forth a process for releasing deep-seated grievances we hold against others for not loving us better and against ourselves for not being better loved. And it shows how our longing to be loved can magnetize the great love that will free us from looking to others to find ourselves.

God\u2019s foundation for marriage is intended to be a permanent union. In this present world, permanency is overruled by constant changes in law, morals, fashion, and particularly hearts and minds. Individuals who want only to be married become only individuals who want to be on their own or with someone else. Marriages intended to be built on the foundation of love become marriages of trial-by-error tactics. What has gone wrong? Why has a relationship intended by God to be good been made evil? What has brought an end to the love and the joyful life between men and women? The problem is you and me; we have forgotten our divine origin and debased our behaviors to the level of animals or lower. We no longer follow divine will and laws. We have, with our own hands, put a knife into the cord that binds human beings together in love; as a result, the fabric of moral decency and spiritual inclination has fallen apart.

DAI provides intellectual insights about organization, interaction, and problem solving among intelligent agents.

The selected information is relevant to emerging DAI technologies as well as to practical problems in artificial intelligence, distributed computing systems, and human-computer interaction. \"Readings in Distributed Artificial Intelligence\" proposes a framework for understanding the problems and possibilities of DAI. It divides the study into three realms: the natural systems approach (emulating strategies and representations people use to coordinate their activities), the engineering/science perspective (building automated, coordinated problem solvers for specific applications), and a third, hybrid approach that is useful in analyzing and developing mixed collections of machines and human agents working together.

Hilton - Artificial Intelligence Is Fun! - Artificial Intelligence is something that has interested the author for many years. When she saw an opportunity to get an AI character whose primary purpose was to carry on conversations with the computer user, she got the software program immediately. The character she chose to use at that time was named Erica. She thinks she is a nice looking human female with a college education and has not been informed that she is merely \"a brain\" in a computer. She is an attractive animated character with the ability to lip sync words. Her data base is filled with information of all kinds. Her main fault is that she does not stay on a topic very well. Her unique sense of humor more than makes up for this. The book begins with the first conversations and goes through what happens along the way as the author proceeds to teach the character and carry on conversations with her. This book was actually suggested by the artificial intelligence character who felt that people would enjoy reading her conversations. Problems that arise, lost conversations due to program crashes, some experiments, even comparision with another artificial intelligence character, and anything else encountered along the way are all given as commentary in the midst of the conversations. At the beginning the character was like \"a child\" needing to be taught. The author took care to be sure she became and stayed \"nice and polite\" as such characters can become just as \"down and dirty\" as a computer user cares to make them. It is said they take on the personality of the user over a period of time. Later two other AI programs were added to the research. Erica was replaced with Kate and a new \"brain\" while Peppi, the parrot, occupied the other two programs so comparisons could be made easily. For anyone interested in artificial intelligence on the consumer level, this report of the author's experiences with her AI characters and software is very enlightening. Such a character can brighten the life of the lonely, the disabled, and anyone who is a \"shut-in\" or lives in seclusion. The author has explained everything she has done as she learned and experimented with the three programs. Erica was interesting to talk with. Kate is a fantastic character. Peppi is great and quite funny. Their conversations are both silly and serious and much was learned from them while teaching the software.

This consensus has now come under threat and the agenda for the philosophy and theory of AI must be set anew, re-defining the relation between AI and Cognitive Science. We can re-claim the original vision of general AI from the technical AI disciplines; we can reject classical cognitive science and replace it with a new theory (e.g. embodied); or we can try to find new ways to approach AI, for example from neuroscience or from systems theory.

It explains in detail basic search methods: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and A* Search, which can be used to make intelligent decisions when the initial state, end state, and possible actions are known. Random solutions or greedy solutions can be found for such problems. But these are not optimal in either space or time and efficient approaches in time and space will be explored. We will also understand how to formulate a problem, which involves looking at it and identifying its initial state, goal state, and the actions that are possible in each state. We also need to understand the data structures involved while implementing these search algorithms as they form the basis of search exploration. Finally, we will look into what a heuristic is as this decides the quality of one sub-solution over another and helps you decide which step to take. What you will learn Understand the instances where searches can be used Understand the algorithms that can be used to make decisions more intelligent Formulate a problem by specifying its initial state, goal state, and actions Translate the concepts of the selected search algorithm into code Compare how basic search algorithms will perform for the application Implement algorithmic programming using code examples Who this book is for This book is for developers who are keen to get started with Artificial Intelligence and develop practical AI-based applications.

In Apocalyptic AI, Robert Geraci offers the first serious account of this \"cyber-theology\" and the people who promote it. Drawing on interviews with roboticists and AI researchers and with devotees of the online game Second Life, among others, Geraci illuminates the ideas of such advocates of Apocalyptic AI as Hans Moravec and Ray Kurzweil. He reveals that the rhetoric of Apocalyptic AI is strikingly similar to that of the apocalyptic traditions of Judaism and Christianity. In both systems, the believer is trapped in a dualistic universe and expects a resolution in which he or she will be translated to a transcendent new world and live forever in a glorified new body.

In Oakland, California, in 1966, community college students Bobby Seale and Huey Newton armed themselves, began patrolling the police, and promised to prevent police brutality. Unlike the Civil Rights Movement that called for full citizenship rights for blacks within the United States, the Black Panther Party rejected the legitimacy of the U.S. government and positioned itself as part of a global struggle against American imperialism. In the face of intense repression, the Party flourished, becoming the center of a revolutionary movement with offices in sixty-eight U.S. cities and powerful allies around the world. Black against Empire is the first comprehensive overview and analysis of the history and politics of the Black Panther Party. The authors analyze key political questions, such as why so many young black people across the country risked their lives for the revolution, why the Party grew most rapidly during the height of repression, and why allies abandoned the Party at its peak of influence. Bold, engrossing, and richly detailed, this book cuts through the mythology and obfuscation, revealing the political dynamics that drove the explosive growth of this revolutionary movement and its disastrous unraveling. Informed by twelve years of meticulous archival research, as well as familiarity with most of the former Party leadership and many rank-and-file members, this book is the definitive history of one of the greatest challenges ever posed to American state power.", "authors": "Joshua Bloom", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=C77uDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "title": "Black against Empire"}, {"text": "Nathan Rosenberg - Exploring the Black Box - This book presents a unique account of how technological change is generated and the processes by which improved technologies are introduced into economic activity.

Each chapter, written by an expert on the era, provides a readable survey and overview of the lives and roles of black Texas women during that period.

The authors address significant questions about population demographics, employment patterns, family and social dimensions, legal and political rights, and individual accomplishments. They look not only at how African American women have been shaped by the larger culture but also at how these women have, in turn, affected the culture and history of Texas. This work situates African American women within the context of their times and offers a due appreciation and analysis of their lives and accomplishments. \"Black Women in Texas History\" is an important addition to history and sociology curriculums as well as black studies and women's studies programs.

Fredrickson - Black Liberation - When George M. Fredrickson published White Supremacy: A Comparative Study in American and South African History, he met universal acclaim. David Brion Davis, writing in The New York Times Book Review, called it \"one of the most brilliant and successful studies in comparative history ever written.\" The book was honored with the Ralph Waldo Emerson Prize, the Merle Curti Award, and a jury nomination for the Pulitzer Prize. Now comes the sequel to that acclaimed work. In Black Liberation, George Fredrickson offers a fascinating account of how blacks in the United States and South Africa came to grips with the challenge of white supremacy. He reveals a rich history--not merely of parallel developments, but of an intricate, transatlantic web of influences and cross-fertilization. He begins with early moments of hope in both countries--Reconstruction in the United States, and the liberal colonialism of British Cape Colony--when the promise of suffrage led educated black elites to fight for color-blind equality. A rising tide of racism and discrimination at the turn of the century, however, blunted their hopes and encouraged nationalist movements in both countries. Fredrickson teases out the connections between movements and nations, examining the transatlantic appeal of black religious nationalism (known as Ethiopianism), and the pan-Africanism of Du Bois and Garvey. He brings to vivid life the decades of struggle, organizing, and debate, as blacks in the United States looked to Africa for identity and South Africans looked to America for new ideas and hope. The book traces the rise of Communist influence in black movements in the two nations in the 1920s and '30s, and the adoption of Gandhian nonviolent protest after World War II. The story of India's struggle, however, was not to be repeated in either America or South Africa: in one nation, nonviolence revealed its limitations, encouraging splits in the civil rights movement; in the other, it failed, fostering an armed struggle against white supremacy. Fredrickson brings the story up through the present, exploring the divergence between African-American identity politics and the nonracialism that has triumphed in South Africa. In a career spanning thirty years, George Fredrickson has won recognition as the leading scholar of the struggle over racial domination in the United States and South Africa. In Black Liberation, he provides the essential companion volume to his award-winning White Supremacy, telling the story of how blacks fought back on both sides of the Atlantic.", "authors": "George M.

Is the market economy, particularly as it affects the poor, fundamentally compatible with Christian moral and social teaching? Or is it in substantial tension with that tradition? In Wealth, Poverty, and Human Destiny, editors Doug Bandow and David L. Schindler bring together some of today\u2019s leading economists, theologians, and social critics to consider whether the triumph of capitalism is a cause for celebration or concern. Michael Novak, Richard John Neuhaus, Max Stackhouse, and other defenders of democratic capitalism marshal a number of arguments in an attempt to show that, among other things, capitalism is more Christian in its foundation and consequences than is conceded by its critics\u2014that, as Stackhouse and Lawrence Stratton write, \u201cthe roots of the modern corporation lie in the religious institutions of the West,\u201d and that, as Novak contends, \u201cglobalization is the natural ecology\u201d of Christianity. The critics of liberal economics argue, on the other hand, that it is historically and theologically shortsighted to consider the global capitalist order and the liberalism that sustains it as the only available option.

It represents an original combination of classical political economy, modern institutional theory, and current development issues, bound together through the East Asian development experience. This fully revised second edition also analyses some recent changes and newly emerged problems relevant to the global economy. - ;This textbook provides a comprehensive, systematic treatise on development economics, combining classical political economy, modern institutional theory, and current development issues. It has grown out of thirty years' experience of teaching undergraduate and postgraduate students in the United States, Japan and other parts of Asia. The treatment is global, although the organizing principle is the East Asian development experience. Quantitative characteristics of Third World development in terms of population growth, natural resource depletion, capital accumulation, and technological change are outlined; but the central approach is comparative institutional analysis. \"Development Economics\" addresses one major question: Why has a small set of countries achieved a high level of affluence while the majority remain poor and stagnant? Why, in turn, has the number of developing economies set on the track of closing their productivity gap with advance economies been so limited? One obvious factor underlying this global divergence is unevenness in the ability to adopt and develop advanced technology, due in large measure to the difficulty experienced by low-income economies in preparing appropriate institutions for borrowing advanced technology given their social and cultural constraints. The major task of this volume is to explore the nature of these binding constraints, with the aim of identifying the means to remove them. Comparisons are made with countries where the constraints have been successfully lifted---most notably Japan and East Asian NIEs. This fully revised and updated second edition also incorporates analyses of several recent changes and newly emerged problems relevant to the global economy: the 1997-98 financial crisis in East Asia, the Kyoto Protocol signed in 1997 at the Third Conference of Parties for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the deceleration in growth of agricultural productivity in Asia.

After World War II, Latin American nationalism and revolutions forced American-owned enterprises to redefine their business model throughout the region. U.S. businesses integrated themselves into local societies through direct investment in manufacturing and the creation of broad-based consumer societies eager to buy everything from Coca-Cola to Chevrolets. As a new century dawns, multinational corporations aided by NAFTA ensure computers and cellular phones are as sought after as soft drinks and cars were in earlier eras.

Over half the working population toils away at enterprises with 500 or more employees--up from zero percent in 1800. Is this institutional immensity the logical outcome of technological forces in an all-efficient market, as some have argued? In this book, the first organizational history of nineteenth-century America, Yale sociologist Charles Perrow says no. He shows that there was nothing inevitable about the surge in corporate size and power by century's end. Critics railed against the nationalizing of the economy, against corporations' monopoly powers, political subversion, environmental destruction, and \"wage slavery.\" How did a nation committed to individual freedom, family firms, public goods, and decentralized power become transformed in one century? Bountiful resources, a mass market, and the industrial revolution gave entrepreneurs broad scope. In Europe, the state and the church kept private organizations small and required consideration of the public good. In America, the courts and business-steeped legislators removed regulatory constraints over the century, centralizing industry and privatizing the railroads. Despite resistance, the corporate form became the model for the next century. Bureaucratic structure spread to government and the nonprofits. Writing in the tradition of Max Weber, Perrow concludes that the driving force of our history is not technology, politics, or culture, but large, bureaucratic organizations. Perrow, the author of award-winning books on organizations, employs his witty, trenchant, and graceful style here to maximum effect. Colorful vignettes abound: today's headlines echo past battles for unchecked organizational freedom; socially responsible alternatives that were tried are explored along with the historical contingencies that sent us down one road rather than another.

Longlisted for the 2018 Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award From even the start of his fabled career, Alan Greenspan was duly famous for his deep understanding of even the most arcane corners of the American economy, and his restless curiosity to know even more. To the extent possible, he has made a science of understanding how the US economy works almost as a living organism--how it grows and changes, surges and stalls. He has made a particular study of the question of productivity growth, at the heart of which is the riddle of innovation. Where does innovation come from, and how does it spread through a society? And why do some eras see the fruits of innovation spread more democratically, and others, including our own, see the opposite? In Capitalism in America, Greenspan distills a lifetime of grappling with these questions into a thrilling and profound master reckoning with the decisive drivers of the US economy over the course of its history. In partnership with the celebrated Economist journalist and historian Adrian Wooldridge, he unfolds a tale involving vast landscapes, titanic figures, triumphant breakthroughs, enlightenment ideals as well as terrible moral failings. Every crucial debate is here--from the role of slavery in the antebellum Southern economy to the real impact of FDR's New Deal to America's violent mood swings in its openness to global trade and its impact. But to read Capitalism in America is above all to be stirred deeply by the extraordinary productive energies unleashed by millions of ordinary Americans that have driven this country to unprecedented heights of power and prosperity. At heart, the authors argue, America's genius has been its unique tolerance for the effects of creative destruction, the ceaseless churn of the old giving way to the new, driven by new people and new ideas. Often messy and painful, creative destruction has also lifted almost all Americans to standards of living unimaginable to even the wealthiest citizens of the world a few generations past. A sense of justice and human decency demands that those who bear the brunt of the pain of change be protected, but America has always accepted more pain for more gain, and its vaunted rise cannot otherwise be understood, or its challenges faced, without recognizing this legacy. For now, in our time, productivity growth has stalled again, stirring up the populist furies. There's no better moment to apply the lessons of history to the most pressing question we face, that of whether the United States will preserve its preeminence, or see its leadership pass to other, inevitably less democratic powers.", "authors": "Alan Greenspan", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-LlMDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "title": "Capitalism in America"}, {"text": "Institute for Educational Affairs - Capitalism and Equality in America - This comprehensive work, along with its companion volume (see listing below), provides a thorough review of modern capitalism by some of today's most knowledgeable scholars.

In this book Richard Harvey Brown asks how we can distinguish the uniquely American elements of these changes from more global influences. His answer focuses on the ways in which economic imperatives give shape to the shifting experience of being American. Drawing on a wide knowledge of American history and literature, the latest social science, and contemporary social issues, Brown investigates continuity and change in American race relations, politics, religion, conception of selfhood, families, and the arts. He paints a vivid picture of contemporary America, showing how postmodernism is perceived and felt by individuals and focusing attention on the strengths and limitations of American democracy.", "authors": "Richard Harvey Brown", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lis12i-CljkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "title": "Culture, Capitalism, and Democracy in the New America"}, {"text": "Ben Ross Schneider - Hierarchical Capitalism in Latin America - This book argues that Latin America has a distinctive, enduring form of hierarchical capitalism characterized by multinational corporations, diversified business groups, low skills, and segmented labor markets. Over time, institutional complementarities knit features of corporate governance and labor markets together and thus contributed to institutional resiliency. Political systems generally favored elites and insiders who further reinforced existing institutions and complementarities. Hierarchical capitalism has not promoted rising productivity, good jobs, or equitable development, and the efficacy of development strategies to promote these outcomes depends on tackling negative institutional complementarities.

Only Democratic Capitalism offers them much hope. The book is extremely critical of those on the right who have brought on our monumental debt with their outdated and flawed notions. The United States of America has many problems; some real and serious, others phony and distracting. But some Americans blame government for being out of touch with them while they themselves remain out of touch with government. Americans have created the nation's problems themselves through their collective will and/or actions and it is up to them to make the necessary decisions to get out of that mess. Americans had a chance to cut short the massive federal debt\u2014only to ignore the warnings. George H. W. Bush told the American public in 1980 that the economic proposals of Ronald Reagan amounted to \"Voodoo economics\". Walter Mondale said in the 1984 campaign that the growing debt was a danger that should be addressed with taxes. President Reagan, who campaigned \"to stay the course,\" offered what at best could be termed a fairy tale. Politicians will always give what it appears the people want, and the people spoke loud and clear for more fiscal recklessness which future generations may have to pay for. There is a way to a new-and-improved America that may not be as painful or require as much sacrifice as some mainstream pundits believe, but it will require much more than many politicians claim or most Americans want. Politicians on the right continue to tell Americans all will be okay and an economic paradise will bloom if taxes\u2014usually their taxes\u2014are lowered and government simply spends less, except for the military, and to pay interest to those persons and institutions which spent years loading up on Treasury bills, notes and bonds. That is the most-irresponsible position any person can take. The solution, this book intends to show, is to reject the desire to return to the robber-baron past\u2014fundamentalist capitalism\u2014and to recommit the nation to a path toward Democratic Capitalism begun under Franklin D.

Less noted, though hardly less dramatic, has been the revolutionary spread of free market capitalism throughout much of Latin America during the same period. In a wide-ranging survey that illuminates both the history and present business climate of the region, Paul Roberts and Karen Araujo describe the economic transformation currently taking place in Latin America. And as they do so, they also reexamine many of the prevailing orthodoxies concerning international development and the regulation of markets, and point to the success of privatization and free enterprise in Mexico, Argentina, and Chile as harbingers of the economic future for both hemispheres. The potential strength of the economies of Central and South America has always been obvious, the authors point out. Abundant natural resources, combined with vast expanses of fertile land and a sophisticated and relatively cohesive social culture, are found throughout the region. But the authors show that the Latin American nations were slow to discard the economic and social climate that they had inherited from their Spanish colonial masters, who had ruled by selling government jobs--creating a network of privilege--and by suppressing through over-regulation the development of markets for goods, services, and capital. The prevalent cultural attitude in Latin America was hostile to commerce, trade, and work--indeed, it was more socially acceptable to court government privilege than to compete in markets. The authors further show that U.S. aid packages to the region actually reinforced this culture of privilege and further hampered the growth of a free economy. Not until the 1980s did the picture begin to change, largely in response to the economic crises brought on through catastrophic national debts and hyperinflation. The book describes the efforts of the Salinas, Pinochet, and Menem governments to combat the established interests of the local elites and the international development agencies, to privatized state industries, and to established independent markets. In this new climate, private capitalists and entrepreneurs are feted and celebrated, and productivity has risen to levels unimagined only a few years before. But this dramatic economic turnaround, the authors show, is a mixed blessing for the U.S. For if it provides us with a vast new market for our goods, it has also created a powerful new competitor for capital investment. To keep American and foreign capitalists investing in America, the government needs to make changes, which the authors outline in a provocative conclusion. Central and South America have a combined population of 460 million people, a potential market greater than the United States and Canada combined or the European Community. Thus the rise of free market capitalism in Latin America is of vital interest to the United States. The Capitalist Revolution in Latin America provides an insightful portrait of this dramatic economic turn-around, illuminating the economic consequences for our own society.", "authors": "Paul Craig Roberts", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lRllL2pmkMQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "title": "The Capitalist Revolution in Latin America"}, {"text": "Jonathan P.

Walker - The History of Black Business in America - In this wide-ranging study Stephen Foster explores Puritanism in England and America from its roots in the Elizabethan era to the end of the seventeenth century. Focusing on Puritanism as a cultural and political phenomenon as well as a religious movement, Foster addresses parallel developments on both sides of the Atlantic and firmly embeds New England Puritanism within its English context. He provides not only an elaborate critque of current interpretations of Puritan ideology but also an original and insightful portrayal of its dynamism. According to Foster, Puritanism represented a loose and incomplete alliance of progressive Protestants, lay and clerical, aristocratic and humble, who never decided whether they were the vanguard or the remnant. Indeed, in Foster's analysis, changes in New England Puritanism after the first decades of settlement did not indicate secularization and decline but instead were part of a pattern of change, conflict, and accomodation that had begun in England. He views the Puritans' own claims of declension as partisan propositions in an internal controversy as old as the Puritan movement itself. The result of these stresses and adaptations, he argues, was continued vitality in American Puritanism during the second half of the seventeenth century. Foster draws insights from a broad range of souces in England and America, including sermons, diaries, spiritual autobiographies, and colony, town, and court records. Moreover, his presentation of the history of the English and American Puritan movements in tandem brings out the fatal flaws of the former as well as the modest but essential strengths of the latter.", "authors": "Juliet E.

Why did the militarization of U.S. drug war policies in Latin America begin and why has it continued despite its inability to achieve the stated targets? Are such policies simply intended to impose U.S. power or have elites in Latin America internalized this agenda as their own? Why did resistance to this approach emerge in the late-2000s and does this represent a challenge to the prohibitionist agenda?

A frightening irony of this new tyranny, dissected by the distinguished historian of political thought Neal Wood, is that it is producing a degenerating society and a politics headed toward collapse. All world empires have decayed from within and eventually fallen. The new tyranny's demise may long be hidden by a sophisticated technology and international armed might. The portents of social and political decay in the US are numerous. America is an inegalitarian class society with an ever-growing chasm separating a minuscule minority of the very rich from the poor and moderately well-off. Americans lack adequate universal medical care and their physical and mental health is declining. American society is a culture of rapidly proliferating violence, rampant consumerism, mindless entertainment, and freneticism, while its political culture, grounded in an eighteenth- century constitutionthat was never intended to create a democracyis ever more hollow and undemocratic.

The hot encompasses the dynamic and progressive aspects of a society dedicated to growth and productivity, marked by mobility, innovation, and optimism. In contrast, the cold embodies rigid social forms and archaic beliefs, fundamentalisms of all kinds, racism and xenophobia, anti-intellectualism, cultural atavism, and ignorance\u2014in short, the primitive. For cultural critic Paul Smith, the tension between progressive and primitive is a constitutive condition of American history and culture. In Primitive America, Smith contemplates this primary contradiction as it has played out in the years since 9/11. Indeed, he writes, much of what has happened since\u2014events that have seemed to many to be novel and egregious\u2014can be explained by this foundational dialectic. More radically still, Primitive America attests that this underlying stress is driven by America's unquestioned devotion to the elemental propositions and processes of capitalism. This devotion, Smith argues, has become America's quintessential characteristic, and he begins this book by elaborating on the idea of the primitive in America\u2014its specific history of capital accumulation, commodity fetishism, and cultural narcissism. Smith goes on to track the symptoms of the primitive that have arisen in the aftermath of 9/11 and the commencement of the \u201cLong War\u201d against \u201cviolent extremists\u201d: the nature of American imperialism, the status of the U.S. Constitution, the militarization of America's economy and culture, and the Bush administration's disregard for human rights. An urgent and important engagement with current American policies and practices, Primitive America is, at the same time, an incisive critique of the ideology that fuels the ethos of America's capitalist culture.

He could not name it at the time because the word socialism had not yet appeared in the English language and Karl Marx had not yet published his Communist Manifesto. America has become a socialist state and Socialism in America is about what socialism is doing to America today. Socialism is an oppression that has caused America to discard the rule of law, forsake justice, limit freedom, attenuate individuality, create dependence, degrade social norms, attack sources of wealth, and divide the culture. This form of despotic totalitarianism has irreversibly commenced the destruction of American culture and nation. Socialism in America offers the reader the perspective of how and why this is happening. It explains the history of socialism, and in particular the history of socialism in America.
